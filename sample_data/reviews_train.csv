Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,I went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon Four of us were there for lunch out of four two of us opted for the sunday brunch and the other two went for la carte I was among the two who went for la carte For the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band The ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded they offer open air seating as well The starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor Personally I felt the seating isn t much comfortable as the chairs backrest lacked comfort The air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside wasn t as comfortable as I expected it to be However the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can Coming to the food I had ordered Mutton Sukha Rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns My companions went for the sunday brunch as they told me the non vegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless All the starters were very well balanced in flavour the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite Compared to the starters the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing Prawn cocktail was outstanding the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet Coming to the la carte menu the Mutton Sukha was great in every way the spices were perfectly balanced they weren t overpowering the flavour of the meat it s definitely a must try there The rib eye steak didn t impress me much the meat wasn t juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing On the other hand the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant they were served on a bed of saut d spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour Overall it s a great place to visit which serves dishes from all the major cuisines around the world ,4.0,2

The Glass Onion,Went here for the first time and the place didn t disappoint Would love to see more seating places on the outside in the open Great food and lovely ambience a must visit ,4.0,2
Marsala Food Company,Today I visited this place along with a few friends Located at the third level of a building right opposite DLF it is at an easily reachable location The lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby The dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too One can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables The ambience is good The place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions We started with soups We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn t that thick too On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it Also it had baby corn carrots beans and such which made it even more better Next we had starters Chicken Pahadi The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab This is batter fried paneer slices The batter and it s seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing I do recommend these Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that prawn taste It was good but did not feel like having prawns Golden fried Baby corn was also good Chilli Paneer was disappointing The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it It is khova filled mushrooms I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person Next we had Mandis The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi We also had some milkshakes KitKat Butterscotch and Strawberry I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary Now coming to desserts I was not that satisfied with the desserts The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit They were not bad but not really good too We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good The desserts need improvement The place is definitely worth a visit ,5.0,2

Behrouz Biryani,Well this is an absolute honest review from a hardcore Hyderabadi and a true foodie I understand a lot of people complain about behrouz biryani but here s my review behrouz is not a Hyderabadi biryani and is unique in itself and the brand claims it s biryani not being local I might not like it to the core as an Hyderabadi but as a food critique I don t have any complaints it s unique in it s preparation was absolutely mild ordered chicken lazeez biryani which had juicy chicken pieces the quantity was sufficient for two moderate eaters was aromatic and we ll garnished with dry fruits Felt the flavour was somewhere between a regular biryani and Mandi now this review even holds strong backing as I had a Irani friend who liked it as well Really loved the packaging and the complimentary desert The gulab jamun definitely killed the joy at the end did regret eating it and the mint raitha can definitely do be improved Overall Taste Price Packaging VFM ,4.0,2
Olive Garden,We visited this place on a weeknight so there was very less crowd The veg food was okay On nonveg side we tried their buffet They served soup with starters salad and some veg starters The soup and the starters the apolo fish and the chicken kebab which was not even close to any kebab was good The curry and roti was okay and the biryani they served was tasty Overall the food was not bad with very reasonable rate The place was comfortable and the service was quick ,4.0,2

13 Dhaba,We had been wanting to visit Dhaba for quite some time having heard the raving reviews about their North Indian preparations Finally ended up trying their steaming hot gobsmacking parathas and they re truly some of the best you can find in Hyderabad The Aloo Tawa Paratha is actually stuffed with loads of filling as compared to other places that serve doughy parathas The Paneer kulcha was also smothered in butter and served with onions and curd We ordered the small Aloo Paratha but it was ginormous and we were almost full by the time we were done with it They serve other north Indian delicacies like Rajma Chawal Kadhi Chawal Dal Makhni and Lassi which are on our To Try list ,4.0,2

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Starters Kalbi Bokum Sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns Prawns toasted in fresh herbs lime pepper and chilly flakes Main course Naga Steam Fish made with Naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes Teriyaki Chicken served with flavoured rice and green vegetables Drinks Summer Time and Summer Lime Orange juice served with fresh orange mint and lime commingled with masala Fresh Lime Soda sweet Of the four dishes listed above the first three were recommended by Madcapmanikin And even though I trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food the woman does know good food She hasn t been off with her recos even once But Zing s came highly recommended by Suchismita Chatterjee Dutta as well the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point In all honesty when the starters arrived I felt that the portions were quite small I couldn t taste the prawns because allergies but the Enlightened One felt that they could ve been a tad fresher And even though the waiter told me that the KalbiBokum wasn t too sweet I could ve lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy But believe you me when I say that the main courses changed the game completely The first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush The explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic I literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal The raw mango slices the fresh fish the tangy tomatoes oh The side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again And the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish shuntki maachh just slayed this Bangal It was only by the end of the meal that I realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up The quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally THIS IS COMFORT FOOD SANELY PRICED IMPECCABLY PORTIONED HONEST FOOD THAT WARMS YOU UP FROM WITHIN ,5.0,2

Cafe Eclat,Happened to try the breakfast option here It is a good place to have english breakfast All the ingredients are cooked baked fresh The breads are really soft We ordered swiss Muesli it was delicious However the portion served was too less for bucks It was not sufficient for even a single person We ordered baked spinach omelette which was fluffy and melted in mouth I have to say the taste was something I would wanna return here again for French toast served with maple syrup was also nicely made Taste is spot on and so is the ambience with comfy sofas A bit expensive due to their natural flavours and self made products ,4.0,2

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Firstly the ambience is amazing I like the way the whole decor is simple yet endearing While the building is not impressive from the outside the set up is pretty good Coming to the food the spread was lavish Especially the desserts were amazing and are definitely the highlight of the buffet However we ordered mocktails which were a disappointment Further there were hardly any starters which was definitely something that we did not expect The staff was cordial and quite helpful when we needed cutlery or help with a dish Overall definitely worth a visit ,4.0,2
American Wild Wings,American Wild Wings is another fast food joint located amidst the Cream Stone outlet of Gachibowli The place is open and has an ideal sitting space for people Went there with my friends to try out their food I found their Ambiance quite ordinary and I felt it can get some makeover Starting with their appetizers We first tried out their in house Chicken wings So the chicken wings served over here are classified into various types They offer a wide range of sauces for their wings ranging from classic Texas BBQ Pattaya Thai Spicy Garlic Amazon wild etc My personal favorite of the lot had to be Original hot Chicken wings and Mexican wild Chicken wings The wings were super juicy and delicious However I also feel that the sauce content was too much for the wings which can be slightly reduced in order to make it taste perfect Next up we had their Classic Chicken Nuggets and Popcorn Chicken The nuggets were super tasty and very much similar to what we usually get to eat at all fast food outlets The Popcorn chicken was chewy It requires serious attention and changes For mains the place has also introduced authentic Indian dishes such as Chicken Biryani with Salan Raita and Gongura Chicken The Gongura Chicken was an absolute relish To my surprise the meat fell of the bone quite nicely and it worked really nicely with the clean flavors of the Biryani Thanks for a wonderful time Mr Srinivas Moreover this place is comparatively quite pocket friendly and can be given a shot for their Chicken Wings anyday Happy eating ,4.0,2

American Wild Wings,Rating Visited this place on a Friday evening The interiors are okayish they need to work alot upon that Now coming to food We tried their wings in different sauces Most of them were really good and the chicken was fresh and meat fell off the bone My personal favorite was Mexican jerk Barbeque and Konaseema Though the sauces can be reduced a little Also the lemon garlic and original hot need to be improved The lemon garlic had so much oil in it and the original hot tasted nothing but red chilli powder We also ordered Virgin Mojito which was very very sweet for our palate The Chicken Caesar salad was a big disappointment as it was full of lettuce and sauces The chicken was very chewy We also ordered Chicken Biryani and Patiala Chicken The biryani was good but had a lot of oil in it Meat was fresh and tender Patiala Chicken had good flavors but alot of masala in it Also the Chicken Popcorn can be completely avoided as the chicken is very rubbery and needs alot of improvement The white sauce pasta again was very sweet for our liking Overall this place needs alot of improvement but you can definitely try out their wings as they are good and economically priced ,4.0,2

Cafe Eclat,I loved the feel of the place as soon as I entered it Though small but it s well maintained and gives you a cosy environment Give the bakery items it specialises in the spread of their menu was quite elaborate and gives you good options to choose from The preparation is rich fresh and gives a good after feeling once you ve eaten it I d specifically mention the croissants that just melt in your mouth The Almond Croissant Pain Au Chocolat are must try Tomato and Cheddar Cheese Croissant too is something that was different and relishing The hot chocolate beverage too was consistent and wasn t too sweet or bitter it was just apt I d certainly go to this place repeatedly and try the other items too But I d recommend going to this place and having it then and there as the delivery orders don t usually come on time and thus spoil the taste of the preparation It s best to indulge yourself in the sins at the cafe than inviting the guilt home ,4.0,2

Driven Cafe,It is my late night stop when I am in need for a coffee Have been there dozen of times The most eye catchy thing about the cafe is the super bikes and cars parked outside The cafe has a rustic ambiance and is decorated with bikes and posters I usually end up having a cup of coffee or a hot chocolate I loved them both So if you are craving for a coffee in the middle of the night then this is the place to go Not only this they have amazing cars and bikes for rent So a must visit place ,4.0,2
The Glass Onion,I will start off by talking about it s ambience and location which I believe and am sure most will agree are it s highlights Located inside the serenity of Boulder hills away from the hullabaloo of the busy city it offers a sense of calm The simple yet elegant decor is what clicked for me right from the moment I walked in It has both and indoor and outdoor sitting The indoor sitting though comfortable and well lit I would suggest the outdoor one simply because of the view it has to offer The streches of green pasture of the golf club adjacent to it and the mild breeze that blows across it definitely refreshes your soul as you sit sipping on your drink I visited it on a summer evening and it was a pleasant experience to say the least Now coming to the food and beverages part definitely a little on the bulkier side but you got to expect that from a place like this located in the midst of all VIP locality The cocktails are good and do ask the waiter for in house food specialities which may not be mentioned in the menu And yes they have a novel concept of High tea served along with alcoholic beverages which is served during the early hours of the evening pm with the set up they have I believe this is a must try Overall it s a nice place to spend a quiet afternoon or evening with family or friends P S Don t go there looking for dance and high pitch music you might be disappointed ,4.0,2

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,A beautiful Asian restaurant with awesome food Food Tried some items from their special menu and some from their normal menu The soup was awesome and the way it was presented with two clear demarcation between the two flavors made it even more special The dumplings were really good it was juicy at the center with a very thin crust The dumpling dip could have been better though The Nyonya was again very delicious and the lemon grass flavor in the curry was just out of this world The Nasi Goreng was very smelly of dried fish and something that we did not enjoy Have tried their buffet also earlier and liked the unconventional nature of the buffet which servers Indian and Asian together The green curry in the buffet was again very delicious Ambiance This is actually two restaurant under the same roof I am not sure why was that done and other than the buffet it really does not make any sense sense Service Service was again very good They took the time to explain the dishes notified of the possible wait time for any dish and above all were very friendly Price It is priced at per some of the fine dining restaurant and as such is fair The only thing is that in such fine dining set up you should not run a buffet and a la carte in parallel ,4.0,2

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,The best part about this place is ambiance and seating arrangement very unique in style and an enjoyable experience especially when visited with friends family We have to sit on sofas with legs crossed and food is served on short movable table placed on sofa People go here to have mandi the dish that they are meant for We too have ordered chicken stick mandi along with two other chicken starters chicken tikka and chicken wings of which the former was palatable We had mandi for the first time and were flabbergasted by the enormous size of plate and quantity of food Five of us were unable to finish it off rice was soft and chicken pieces were tender and rightly marinated The feeling of multiple people having food from same plate is amusing Their service deserves a special mention they just appear when we need them and give us privacy otherwise Overall this is a must visit to have mandi ,4.0,2

Hyper Local,Review Recently we ve received an invitation from Hyper Local It s on the rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus Gachibowli just next to Platinum Cinemas The place is located in a good open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer And if you go there before Sunset you can enjoy the dawn The Ambiance is pretty good with Full Bar Nightlife Live Music Private Dining Area Available Wi Fi Live Sports Screening Indoor Seating Smoking Area Buffet If you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues this is the perfect place Their food is pretty good with reasonable price I find the prices are on the lower side than any other nearby cafes They are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get pints of Beer including a veg non veg starter But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults no kids allowed Anyway yesterday I went to keep the invitation It was around pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after pm anyday I asked to serve their specialty so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail First they served LSD which is a kickoff cocktail made with types of liqueur like Gin Vodka Tequila Rum Triple Sec and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur made from the dried peels of bitter sweet oranges And with the use of Fresh Orange juice the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail Thought of trying the non alcohol drink first then the cocktail The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco The mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi Mint The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant made the drink so refreshing Usually in bars they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice After that I tried their Chicken Taco Those Tacos were made for Indians so you can t get the blunt taste but the real fusion works here Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas Taste wise they were so good but the only thing which bothered me the Malabar Parota As the parotas have layers so it was difficult to hold the entire thing so I suggested to use plain Wheat Four Maida Tortillas I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken And yes the Tacos were too filling I could have only of them Now it s time for the Cocktail which was literally inviting me to taste it And believe me it was kicking off so strong but nice Orange flavored very refreshing I could only finish the th of the entire portion The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food I left it on them so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek what is that That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried Served with types of dip Mayo Mint raita Sweet Tamarind saffron chutney I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney it went so well together Now you might be wondering what Baharat spice is As per the Chef the word baharat actually means spices in Arabic and not a single spice but a blend of several spices In this blend you can find black pepper coriander paprika cardamom nutmeg cumin cloves and cinnamon So the chicken keema was cooked with these spices Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa but the taste was very different And that s why the different types of dips were served I felt the food quality quantity is quite enough satisfactory as per price Definetly overall out of Already written about the ambiance out of Location is also easy to reach out of Service was a Professional efficient out of As per my experience young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity quantity of food dink on reasonable price with nightlife live screening beautiful ambiance ,5.0,2

Shanghai Chef 2,Went to this place which a bunch of foodies for a review session and to my delight it turned out to be an awesome experience I always wanted to visit authentic chineese restaurants and this was the one The service was very good along with a perfect ambience Lets begin with the food part We started with a couple of soups Tom Kha Gai which was a coconut milk based chicken soup and it was very yummy as you can feel the coconut flavour followed by lemon corriander soup which was also good Amongst the starters we tried Tei Pei Chicken Kung pao Chicken Phuket fish this was one of the best as the fish was perfectly fried and it was also crispy Drawn prawns nice crispy which nice sausage Now the best part was the Shu mai the dumplings were great and delicious it was my first time though but i found it really great In the main course we had Phad Thai Phak spicy flavored rice with nice flavours and the aroma was too tempting Burmese Khow Suey which were steamed noodles with several add ons like peanuts fried onions etc a must try one if you visit this place We also had some mocktails my personal favorite was Fall in love along with a couple of other like fruit punch The last but not the least the desert part we had fried ice creams which had coconut base and it was very yummy A nice place to visit if you are looking for some authentic chineese dishes ,5.0,2

Hyderabadi Daawat,Hyderabadi Daawat as the name suggests has some authentic Hyderabadi food which you get to eat in the functions here in Hyderabad Ever been to a Hyderabadi Daawat before No not the hotel we re talking about a function well if you ve been to one then You definitely know how much a Hyderabadi loves food and how much he spends on the Menu And here at Hyderabadi Daawat the restaurant you get the same splendid variety of dishes to enjoy The hotel is very easy to locate Its on the main road while coming from ORR or Gachibowli side it comes on the right side and if you re coming from Miyapur side then it will be on Your left The restaurant has simple yet beautiful interiors very calm and cozy place They also have Banquet hall and a Conference hall and they also undertake Catering orders for parties and functions And after the DASTAR was set we sat down for the food and they first brought the YAKHNI SHORBA Shorba is nothing but the soup Yakhni Shorba is a dish from Kashmir people in the North tend to have it more And it is a very good source of protein Usually it is mild in spice level but at Hyderabadi Daawat owing to the spice cravings of Hyderabadis it was made a little spicy But the taste was fantastic It was the best way to start off Your meal Next came the starters in which we were served the Wok tossed chicken Phuket fish Sikandari Raan and Murgh Sholay kebab Let s start with what we loved the most The Sikandari Raan It s one whole leg from the Goat or Sheep You know for a fact that Mutton and Beefs aren t usually as tender as Chicken but the chefs at Hyderabadi Daawat changed this notion entirely The mutton from the Raan was soo soft tender and juicy that Your teeth has no work to do cause it just MELTS And talking about the spices it was very mild in spice and very well marinated Coming to the significance of the name SIKANDARI RAAN Most of You must be knowing that Alexander the Great who had captured almost all parts of the world was known as Sikandar e Azam After winning one of the battles in B C at Takshila he took the ruler called Porus as captive and when Porus was asked what he wanted He told he wanted them to treat him like a king and soo Alexander or Sikandar took him as his friend and arranged for a lavish buffet in which this Raan was signature dish And since then it is named as Sikandari Raan Well we think no other name would have justified the Size and Taste of this dish better than Sikandari Raan A must must have for You all Highly recommended dish if You re here The next best starter was the Phuket fish It s a nice spicy fish coated with finely chopped onions ginger garlic paste and tossed in Soya and Chilli sauce The taste was of another level Next we had the Wok tossed chicken Wok tossed is an East Asian style of cooking where they use woks or metal pans with shallow bowls used for frying or steaming The taste of the chicken was really good with all rightly mixed flavours and spices but it was a bit hard to chew Soo we recommend the chef to look into that And next came the Murgh Sholay Kebab It was the Barbeque styled chicken Very nicely marinated and tender to eat And the presentation was amazingly done After we were done with the starters they brought a very appealing and extremely beautiful dish called Chelo Kebab It was extremely well presented Chelo kebab is an Iranian Dish in which there is cooked rice along with varieties of chicken kebabs The chicken and the rice as well is too mild in spice but rich in flavour After this the main course was started in which we were served the Chicken Lababdar Nihari Gosht and Murgh Musallam with Butter Naan Nihari Gosht was Love it wasn t like the usual Nihari that You eat on a regular basis It was different and very thick and spicy And the mutton which they used was really tender Do try this dish here Chicken lababdar was really lababdar along with the butter naan it was a perfect combo Murgh Musallam was completely different here when compared to the Murgh Musallam we had at other places Here they serve the Murgh Musallam with rice And the meat is filled with minced mutton and eggs You should definitely try this dish We were done with all this but how can You even think that a Hyderabadi daawat would end without the Hyderabadi Biryani We had the Mutton Biryani it was very rich in flavours and seasoned with good amount of roasted onions The aroma of the Ghee added to the taste of the Biryani And the Daawat came to an end with the desserts You commonly find in a Hyderabadi Daawat Matka Firni and Double ka Meetha Double ka Meetha is the very usual dish You see in the functions of Hyderabad It is made with roasted breads to which milk cinnamon and almond powder are added And at Hyderabadi Daawat it was perfectly made and was served Hot Overall the lunch here was a Terrific experience and we all just loved it And also a special mention to the Owner of this place who is a very Kind hearted and a humble person He speaks to You related anything and everything You have to ask or tell and takes the Feedback whether good or bad with a smile Way to go Sir ,5.0,2

American Wild Wings,We happened to visit American Wild Wings on a Friday evening and the place was desolated The place is tidy and can have a better ambiance keeping in view their concept We started with a lemon mojito Though refreshing it was a tad too sweet for my liking We thought salad would be a good start but unfortunately our Chicken Ceasar salad was drenched in dressing It almost tasted like we ate the lettuce with the sauce and not otherwise Then came in an array of wings each with their own signature sauces We tried different sauces and liked most of them All the wings were fried well and had a good crunch Of all the sauces my top picks were there barbeque konaseema amd mexican jerk Barbeque had a perfect sweet to tang ratio the konaseema had a nice curry spice flavor with hints of pepper coriander and coconut and the Mexican jerk had a garlicky peri peri kind of flavor Must try sauces While these sauces were good few sauces like the lemon garlic and original hot were disappointing The lemon garlic was doused with oil and it was floating around in our plate The original hot didn t taste of anything but spice and bitterness They also have a sauce names Atomic the hottest on their menu It was indeed very hot for my liking We also tried a drumstick in atomic sauce and it was decent Chicken nuggets were good Nothing out of the ordinary Though their USP is wings they succumbed to peer pressure and started serving Biryanis fried rice and a few curries We tried their chicken fry piece biryani and it had a unique flavor The meat was cooked well amd the level of spice was apt but the bottom half of the biryani was an oil well Chicken Punjabi a sarson ka saag version was actually really good It had the perfect saag flavor Again too oily Upon their suggestion we tried their pasta in white sauce and chicken popcorn both of which were terrible The pasta was rancid and the popcorn felt like chewing on cardboard Stay away Another thing we noticed was the temperature of the dishes The first serving of our wings was dead cold When brought to their notice the second serving was mouth burning hot The biryani seemed like it was heated in the serving bowl The bowl was so hot we couldn t even pick it to put the food in our plates Overall they do have potential but have a lot of areas to improve The quality of wings and sauces is good but the other areas like the usage of oil in dishes serving temperature and the freshness of ingredients needs to be worked upon They also need to quickly improve on the ambiance and vibe of the place to attract crowds Price wise they are pretty pocket friendly Taste Ambiance Service Value for money ,4.0,2

Hyderabadi Daawat,I am a huge fan of regional cuisines The diversity in our regional cuisines exhibits so much about the range India possess It also talks about the immense depth in terms of culture and it s just a festival of flavors Cities especially witness the change in the culture and places like Hyderabad is an amalgamation of so many from the Nizams Rayalseema to telugu cuisines Hyderabadi Dawaat is one such place which is trying to restore the age old tradition and bring back the cuisine of Nizams From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis the menu for the place is full of culinary delights and I was really excited to go for it As I went in for a dinner we started with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba a great start to the meal With every sip the intense flavor starts to get you Then there was an array of appetizers that really got me We had the Achaari Paneer Tikka where pieces of paneer were marinated in a flavorful tangy achaari mix For the non vegetarians we had Murgh Kalmi Kebab where the chicken leg pieces were marinated in a balanced spice mix The Gosht Seekh Kebab was wonderful as well It was juicy mutton kebabs and lastly the Patrani Fish The fish was perfectly cooked and the flavors of coconut cream enhanced the taste The restaurant also took the pain to present us their special Sikandari Rann where a whole leg of lamb is marinated with whole spices and then cooked in a tandoor It was served on a bed of fried onions garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side Every single element from that whole ensemble stood out for me and made my day Moreover there were also some Persian Chelo kebabs and Murgh Mussallum for us to enjoy served along with their range of condiments The Rann was not enough and the restaurant decided to bring more stuff for us We had Gosht Masala Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which was served alongside with some piping hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans The Nargisi Kofta was my favourite of the night It just had the right balance of flavors and made me go gaga over it The Gosht Masala was spicy but the Achari Chicken was incredible too Desserts like Gil e Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal In a nutshell the true culture and authentic flavors of Hyderabad is being exhibited here So Hyderabadi Dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list Go give them a visit ,4.0,2

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,A must visit place for their exquisite Asian cuisine not just for the dishes they offer but also for the authentic taste of those dishes The ambience is so appropriate to aggrevate your hunger and salivate your mouth One does start feeling the aura of fine dine for which the crockery and cutlery is the first noticable example We ordered vegetable chilli sticks salt and pepper chicken as starters Vegetable chilli sticks st pic is a must for all vegetarians here if felt really satiating having tasted one of the best Chinese dish I ever ordered Salt and pepper chicken was good as told by my accompanying friend I found the texture good He rates it For Main course we ordered chilli garlic soft noodles and button mushroom and diced babycorn in oyster sauce gravy dish Chilly garlic noodles were cooked with finesse with perfect combination of spices and flavour of veggies very balanced A must to mention is the quantity served it can be shared by people Button mushroom diced babycorn in oysters sause this dish is basically fried mushroom and babycorns tossed in oyster sauce that is medium spicy It blended so perfectly with the spicy noodles I also ordered virgin mojito which comprised of ice and only ice and they charged bucks for that Final verdict authentic asian food with great ambeicne with Zomato gold it makes it really worth giving it not just one try but visit here frequently ,4.0,2

Biryanis And More,I cant fully comment or give a full star rating but I would definitely start with a star as the kebabs I ordered were simply one of the best I have ever had I ordered Chicken Malai kebab and Chicken Hara Mirchi kebab Both the kebabs were juicy and succulent with individual distinct flavors in each of them I really like it when one kebab doesnt taste like the other and each has its own unique flavor While the homeminister like the less spicy and creamy flavor of the chicken malai kebab I preferred the tangyness of the hara mirchi kebab Although a bit on the pricier side given the flavors and the taste I am definitely waiting for a chance to order their biryani because if the kebabs are to go by anything the biryani would definitely be flavorsome Food Value for Money ,4.0,2

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Having heard a lot of hype surrounding this place and the rating on Zomato it was on my wishlist for ages but I was always skeptical of the taste being too authentic and a totally new cuisine The former proved to be true and was the primary reason I didn t have a very pleasing dinner It s a small and cute little diner like Cafe with minimalistic and soothing interiors The sour smell of fermentation was nauseating initially but I got used to it in just a few minutes Some room freshener would do the trick The items are priced very cheap I had high expectations but only to learn later the portions are just too small We had SPICY DRUMS OF HEAVEN The only thing I could properly finish A typical batter fried chicken Almost south Indian and spicy in taste but the coating was too thick CHICKEN SUCCULENT YAKITORI skewers with tiny chicken chunks spring onion stem and a sesame seed drizzle Texture was good but taste average Sticky barbeque sauce coating it felt like CHICKEN MOMOS Standard good amount of filling with a very pungent ginger flavor The coating was thick too Chilli chutney served alongside was not too spicy and went well with the Momos BOSAM It was my first time trying pork belly and I can t really judge but it felt fatty and gooey The pieces were drenched in grease Served with spicy kimchi which I loved CHICKEN RAMYUM NOODLES Big bowl of noodles what looked like Maggi but was only a close resemblance Scarce chicken pieces undercooked dry and hard noodles and overall a very bland taste NAGA STEAM FISH This was the thing causing the smell in the restaurant And I couldn t tolerate it A very very pungent and strong odor The fish had a great texture and was steamed to perfection Served with steamed white rice Whatever I mentioned about the food was just my impression and maybe because it was the first time trying out this new cuisine I didn t really like it However one thing that was disappointing was the service It was slow and just took ages Once the food arrived it was fine but again the bill took more than minutes As many others have already said I guess the strong point of this place is their pork preparations and I would recommend this place purely for that An elaborate menu with lots of options priced well Here s my overall SCORE Food not judging what I tried first time don t know about Ambience get a room freshener Service VFM ,4.0,2
Tiki Shack,Food is decent nothing out of the world yet I am giving this place a stars Good finger food nothing you complain about but the vibe of the place post pm is just electrifying The highlight is the desi dhol beats Total paisa vasool place They don t really have a dance floor but the vibe is so great that every inch which doesn t have a table become a dance floor Lastly the decor is very pretty as well If you want to party cheap and have a blast this is the place for you ,5.0,2

Hyderabadi Daawat,Hyderabadi Cuisine as such is vast and rich in heritage with its deep roots into the tradition s like any other cuisine Generations after generation the cuisine has transformed into more commercial and all we know is few kebabs and dum biryani are the cuisine as such But there is more than just biryani and kebab s Once you get to taste real authentic dishes you will tend to know the richness and diversified delicacies from the land of Nizams You always tend to get such delicacies towards the other part of the city and what the Cyberabad gets its morphed or rather mostly morphed delicacies Wait no more as kondapur gachibowli has got what it has been missing for quite a while Hyderabadi Daawat opened up recently has a clear agenda of serving authentic dishes to commercial crowd and give them more above and beyond than the regular kebab s and biryani My dinner session today had no expectation s from it but then the food spoke for itself Restaurant should be proud to serve some delicacies which you don t get that easily anywhere in vicinity Dishes like MurghMussalam MurghKalmiKebab CheloKebab PatraniFish GoshtMasala SikanderRaan and many more While a few dishes went amiss to excite me all other dishes were completely unique flavors and not quite relatable to palate that s used to typical tandoor kebab s Must Try AchariChicken GoshtMasala KalmiKebab PaneerAchari DalAkbari and NargasiKofta Do focus on such rare delicacies when you go dine there and avoid the regular run around the mill dishes and I m sure you will appreciate the restaurant for bringing you the heritage of culture rich Hyderabadi Daawat Cuisine I m definitely impressed with the menu offerings and their service Mainly Mr Dilawar was so gracious GastroHogger LetsHog HyderabadiDawaat DawaatDelicacies CyberabadCelebrations gastrohogger com,4.0,2

Marsala Food Company,The food of the place was nice except for Murg Malai Tikka the dish was very sweet and not worth for money The reason for giving star rating is my experience in the restaurant which was not only food but also the staff which were very very rude not only while serving food but also while taking order and explaining certain dishes which were named differently on the menu The staff doesn t know how to treat with customers they were unnecessarily speaking and poking nose in our personal conversation and behaving miserably with the people there pretending that is cool behaviour Overall good place to order food from the last place one should go for dine in The staff should learn how to behave with the customers star is also too much depending upon how the staff behaved with us last night when I went with a group of friends ,1.0,0

Chinese Pavilion, Delayedpost date of visit Jan FoodShaukeen ChinesePavilion Chinese Pavilion was one place which was hiding in my wishlist for very long in Chinese category and this wish was fulfilled when a friend wanted to throw a party in a Chinese restaurant and I wasted no time in suggesting this Visited Gachibowli branch which is above CCD and is in the same building of Up the Bistro Their ambience does comply with their cuisine to most and their seating is quite comfortable and can seat up to pax comfortably Pricing is a bit on higher end with most of the dishes are priced above and very few are between A tummyful meal could go up to for AI Have ordered Manchow soup to start our meal which satisfied our taste buds Red Chilli Prawns dry BBQ chicken three treasure veggies and honey glazed potato balls were part of appetizers Prawns Teppan yaki pan fried and tossed along with Chilli Garlic and butter tasted real good BBQ chicken was a decent attempt and could have been more better Show stealer among appetizers was definitely honey glazed potato balls which were delicious with a punch of sweet and a little pepperish a wonderful combo to your taste buds Three treasure veggies had broccoli baby corn and mushrooms and felt more like a salad for me Had it been a little more pan fried with its sauces could have done wonders Among main course was schezwan fried rice and CP special noodles which is made of pan fried noodles and oyster sauce tasted Okish as sauce did not impress me as much as I expected Schezwan rice was delicious though right to the spices Requested for desserts and they dint have anything from their menu except honey noodles Service Though their service is quick staff is not so attentive to the customer for the ad hoc requests and also to take order Something that is important from customer point of view Bottomline there were few misses and few hits However most of the dishes were towards sweeter side I wouldnt mind another try here and see if my first visit is just an exception ,3.5,0

Al Saba Restaurant,The classic example of what happens when all aspects of a restaurant are not taken care of When your service doesnt compliment the food one serves it sometimes leads to disaster Walked in on early lunch and had a tough time asking the waiters to temp down the ac for they have been keeping it at degrees Agreed the influx of customers at lunch demands that but the early birds shouldnt have to suffer because of that Ordered a variety of dishes only to find out fish is not available The service time was also too much I found the waiters to be a little rude I can sense their awkwardness in serving to an Odia table themselves being odia Neways now coming on to the food The chicken biriyani does taste good as far as Hyderabadi Biriyani is considered Other items such as mutton biriyani paneer masala and dal were also good Its a one time visit restaurant but if the restaurant has to give a tough time to counterparts in Gachibowli it has a long way to go Taste Service Ambience Value For Money ,2.5,0

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Komatose on a Sunday night is the perfect place to be happened to be drizzling which made for the perfect atmosphere to chill outside in the cabanas Inside was a pretty small area for a bar but had loads of seating space which extended out to a floor above overlooking the area below Lighting was funky and great the vibrant colors adding to the vibe Being a big bunch we ordered different drinks and luckily I got to taste all The most special of these were from the deadly sins of Koma menu The taste was as described on the menu Lust in particular was something different I d never tasted before a chilli spiced vodka strawberry infusion The appetizers we had we re really good something I enjoyed more than the alcohol Dragon prawns Grilled pomfret Peshawar Chapali Kebabs are some of the must orders Didn t quite like the Nawabi Shikhampuri While all the items tasted great I felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price Best for the last not being a kid here but the mocktails were just mind blowing Had a few different fruit flavors peach mango green apple lime out of which the peach was the best Multiple rounds of that gave me the sugar rush The service was professional and quick Would ve wished for better music and there was no DJ at the music station However we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great It s a perfect place to watch a match screening have a party or if you re in the mood for it go into Comatose Here s my overall SCORE Food Ambience VFM Service ,3.5,0

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Came here for some late night dinner and my experience can be termed Pathetic to say the least They do not believe in serving a glass of water unless specifically asked for after minutes of being there The smell of the cleaning liquid was so strong that i lost my appetite and to top it gave me a splitting headache Although they claim it to be open hours they apparently start cleaning up the place around midnight Customers be damned I asked them to pack up the food because there was no way i was going to eat from there bearing the mind numbing smell After the food parcel was given they wouldn t give me the cheque unless of course again specifically asked for The kind of experience you would expect from a place that serves biryani for Rs and not Rs Endured the minutes of torture grabbed the take away and left ,1.0,0

Frio Bistro,Frio is set in a dark toned theme with black walls and complementing prismic mirrors with dim lighting to set mood for a quiet interesting evening conversation The music is contemporary and thankfully not too loud It moulds into the environment without intruding into your private space Service was fine We had to keep a lookout for waiters rather than them looking out for us but were courteous and friendly Here is what we ordered arabica cold coffee basic and just right Creamy and not too sugary Dark chocolate shake absolute yum and sinful It tastes exactly as you would want it to The only ask since it s categorized as thickshake it should be thicker but I guess that s the case with shakes served anywhere in the city Chicken ala plancha Sheer dissapointment especially given that it was in chef s special menu It was as ordinary as ordinary can be We ordered scallion rice on the side as the dish is incomplete without carbs It s basically a tomato gravy with chicken and hardly any seasoning Wouldn t recommend Lamb ravioli It s a shame we don t get ravioli in most of the outlets across the city serving pasta Even if they do it s mostly vegetarian spinach and ricotta cheese without exception To our delight Frio doesn t disappoint here The ravioli is good doesn t make it to my top list but still good Ravioli was cooked well herbed garlic bread on side was great and so was the tomato gravy We couldn t get to dessert as we ordered our food during the final order mins before closing but I have heard that their tiramisu is great All in all Frio is a good place to visit In terms of food you could love or let s say not love the place basis what dish you ordered I won t be a frequent here but wouldn t mind going back for another try either Happy dining ,3.0,1
Prism Club & Kitchen,Big on ambience food and music Miserably fails at politeness Called up this place to reserve a table for two on a Friday night They said please walk in No reservations required for two The place was sparsely filled but most tables had a reservation and the ones remaining were well About to be reserved so you can t sit If you re less than three head to the bar because that s exactly where they like pushing everyone to The service otherwise is decent but not sure why they are so finicky about holding on to a table that is not occupied The place is all lights and show and great for nightlife The food is decent and the options are a plenty on both the food and liquor front ,3.0,1
Prism Club & Kitchen,I have been on Friday night and reached at round pm It was almost full we hardly get space for standing They occupied huge space and designed interior amazingly which definitely deserve a cover charge as its into business but one thing which nowhere make sense to taking bucks for just entry out of k when every items price also decent to take your business ahead We could not order any snacks except one as we had to carry on hand and could spoil our party mood I must say either they should revoke their concept of charging for entry or should be take responsibility to offer seats atleast when you are visiting as couple or in group Dj was playing good track and it was enjoyable moment we spent Zomato is showing for two ppl which is really surprising even though you cant step down to this place until unless spend k bucks so be aware and keep your pocket tight as this place is not for normal class people ,3.0,1

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,It was a night out with gal pals When we entered the server took us to our sitting area we chose a corner as it had a couch felt it was bit secluded Warm indoors black and brown seatings cartoons of laal street their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the TV They have their own app for ordering but guess what their wifi wasn t available as it was under repair That is what server told us The server came and took our orders We ordered starters and drinks As soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere It kind of scared us then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation Then we started enjoying the music and our orders came The server got one of the drinks wrong we reminded him it was changed he said he already brought this Other places the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast Instead he said he cant take it back Anyways moving on The cocktail which i had were really good The cosmopolitan Beer trap and Screw driver The starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian Italian cheese fingers They were crispy and yum Stuffed mushrooms they were okay and forgettable the Nachos were okay have had better ones The crispy corn was good Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters The music was good Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it first they said at they will start then said it will start We four were only on the dance floor we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song He didnt oblige at all Would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills God knows Food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar Hope they improve their hospitality That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again Food Service Overall experience Because of friends VFM ,3.0,1

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the th floor It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area we have other choices Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there Crabmeat Soup This soup was thick with minced crab meat The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce vineager and crushed pepper The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds Corn Cubes A must try out platter The dish was innovative The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency Chicken Yakitori I did not like this preparation It was very dull and tasteless There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor Main Course Manchow Chicken Fried Rice The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own Dessert Bangkok Custurd I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts It tasted like Firni As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls It was just yum for the greedy tongue Total Rs Inclusive of taxes Cobclusion The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card No coordination among the staffs Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions Its just okayish for casual dinner lunch I will think twice to visit this place again ,3.0,1
Ulavacharu,Have been to this place after hearing lot of good reviews I can rate the food as very delicious specially pachimirchi Kodi Pulao accurately spicy varied dishes in the menu but I had a very bad day with respect to service First of all there were hardly waiters who were available and even though it was not crowded they were unable to address the customers and were confused with the menu as once they said bamboo chicken was not available and then when ordered some other starter came back with bamboo chicken secondly after some time those waiters were missing and the whole floor was left without anyone to take care of guests I hope that this is one of those cases and there wouldn t be other customers facing the same issue given the brand they own ,3.0,1

Barbeque Nation,I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past The only thing they handled well from the word go was the seating I booked a table for from zomato It was ready for us when we arrived Everything else seemed to be falling apart their team was struggling to deliver The starters took forever to be served Most of them tasted similar though were called different things refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this some were duly replaced The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes When we held our ground he went back to personally create some dishes His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together ,3.0,1

Club Rogue,The ambience was decent but we went for a ladies night and it was a tad bit crowded understandable The music was good the only downside to the whole thing was that the person giving out drinks at the counter was downright ignoring us We actually became a little uncomfortable after that because we were right in front of him waving hands not drunk at all because we were asking for out first drink of the night and he was handing out drinks to everyone else except us Looks like he had something againts us ,3.0,1

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,I was feeling like having a late night shake in the pleasant weather and therefore I ordered one through this place Fruit pebble shake was the one which I ordered using Zomato but I think they delivered me the wrong one The shake has the taste of chocolate cookies so it was definitely not fruit Irrespective of that the taste of the shake was average and I think they can improve their bar ,3.0,1
Chinese Pavilion,I had ordered Manchow Soup The taste was very nice It felt like a great start Crispy noodles in it added a great texture and taste to the Soup chicken was cooked well overall a very good subtle starter The Chilli Chicken Dry was One of the best I ve tasted was kinda smoky chicken was cooked very well the prawns quality and taste were justtt totally ammazing cooked to perfection Only drawback was the price and quantity werent up to the mark the Chilli Garlic Burnt Sauce tasted extremely weird The chicken fried rice was not that great too It had good aroma and aura but taste was average The restaurant had good ambience Overall it was good experience,3.0,1
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Visited with family for dinner on a special occasion The valet parking was a relief Unfortunately there was no maitre d and we had to seat ourselves The ambience was great I loved the light colours and bright lighting as it put a positive spin on the evening The food was really good The sushi even the veg variant was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb Service however was lacking on all parameters It was cold and inefficient It was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out couple of women in particular could not catch their names The billing too took an unreasonable amount of time The food here is great but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to Quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant Will we return Perhaps not in the near future the only reason we would return at some point would be Zomato Gold on the food ,3.0,1

The Tilt Bar Republic,They claim to be a European bar who serves continental cuisine Went here with my pals We ordered Peri Peri Chicken pizza and Assorted Pizza Service The waiters were courteous and gave a good suggestion on what to order and helped while splitting the bill as well The service wasn t the quickest with around people in the house Good parking available here Food The pizzas were pretty mediocre I liked the cheese quality and the toppings were in generous amount We asked for a medium crust and the crust was a bit stiff Peri peri chicken was pretty good as the flavor was indulging The pizzas were missing the wow factor and wasn t really specially My friends ordered pastas and wings Wings were pretty good and the pastas were less in quantity and wasn t too good Ambience It has dim low light and calm ambience with a street view and a music Really liked the ambience and the decor as well The tables were typically made out of moulded tin and gave a different feel and look Worth a shot with Zomato Gold Final Verdict Food Ambience Service Hygiene ,3.0,1

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,I had ordered out everytime The packaging is excellent although the food is okayish The shawarma is like having roti and malai chicken The rumali roti is soft and the filling inside is moist There was not punch of flavour but a monotony on the pallette Also their waffles are okayish too ,3.0,1
Frio Bistro,I wish I could give it a but don t have the option Just for the record it deserves a strong closer to a We tried the Pizza Chicken Breast stuffed with spinach spaghetti followed by deserts The Turkish Pizza was the stand out dish for us we did not expect that The others were also very good and I would go again for sure The Tiramisu although looked and smelled great was the biggest let down The Bakhlava was just okay not a bad attempt The Cheese cake on the other hand was yumm Overall I would recommend this place with a word of caution that it is on the expensive side We ended up paying about a per head ,3.0,1
Mathura Vilas,We visited this place many times Not so crowded Good ambience Their thalis are good and a value for money Their ala carte items are not so good in taste and not worth the price esp platters and other starters Their service is very slow and you need to be patient I would rate this restaurant ,3.0,1
Triptify,Ordered Gobi and sattoo paratha as lunch from here This came with dahi butter pickle and chutney Gobi paratha was soft and flavoured and sattoo paratha stuffing was too much and I dint like the taste much as I couldn t get the exact flavour of it The packing of this was excellent which came in a box packing using aluminum foil covering for paratha and every other thing well settled in the box Overall it was okay with the accompaniments and more than sufficient for one person ,3.0,1
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,This was one of those places on my list that I have been wanting to try for the longest time that I can remember I specifically wanted to try out the Sushi Veg in this place I remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for Japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available In any case I ordered a stater shanghai rolls which was average and finally went ahead and ordered Sushi for myself wife and a pizza for my daughter The sushi was good but not as good as the one I had tried at Mamagoto my fav place for asian cuisine The pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic Italian restaurants in the city I also tried their creme brulee best of the lot which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping In my opinion they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself I would have rated it but for their really slow service and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings All in all an average place to try out I might go back to try some of their other items on the menu Ambiance Food Service ,3.0,1

eat.fit,For the first time tried the light lunch meal from Eat fit which has Kcal as mentioned Decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box Chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil Chapatis were homely soft and warm something a bit hard to get in Hyderabad A less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier Not sure if I would order this again but could maybe try their salads ,3.0,1

Chinese Pavilion,Hello This place was bookmarked for a long time now so I wanted to pay it a visit And finally the moment came when I was actually able to go there I am a huge fan of Indo Chinese cuisine and I honestly had a high hope from this place but all in all it was disappointment I ordered chicken manchow soup which was good although the salt was on the higher side Hakka noodles and fried rice has too much oil and there s no reason for that amount of oil to be there in the Chinese food Wolly chicken and chicken chilli dry had extreme amount of garlic which weren t properly fried and rather than giving a good taste it made the entire dish difficult to eat as the flavour was overpowering All in all the food wasn t enjoyable Will I visit again Probably not I am sorry Thanks ,3.0,1

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,This place is good unless you look at the menu card It s like drinking alcohol and having good food and finding out you paid extra which you could have saved if you would have gone to a similar place with much less to spend rs for a glass of wine Well not worth going twice specially if other places are serving the same wine for a glass But if you re a first timer the you must visit just to remind yourself there are other places much more cheap than this DJ plays some really nice music And one advantage is that this place is opened till am ,3.0,1

Eat India Company,A group of we decided to visit this place on Saturday evening The location is quite on the main road however the parking and the entry is terrible They can surely improve in this aspect as it can be a big turn off After entering the restaurant we were quite impressed with the ambience and the decor It had a very India taste to it They had old locks keys doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look Coming to the food there is a plethora of options on their menu Instead of going through it all we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer Hariyali Paneer Tikka and Corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination Corn cubes cannot be missed here My friend ordered a Chicken starter which was quite average though Moving to main course we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries Paneer Lababdar Mushroom curry and Nizami Handi seemed like good choices Food was decent The service was not impeccable It ca surely be improved Also they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal Quite a surprise The price point is a little on the higher side probably much more than average It can be a great negative They accepted gold on food so yay Overall a good experience but probably not one worth visiting again ,3.0,1

Prism Club & Kitchen,By Invite The pub is located in the Financial District in Gachibowli the pub is currently the largest in Hyderabad in terms of area As you enter you cross your way through a large parking space and pathway to overlook a huge monkey like figure enjoying music The pub feels start as soon as a glance falls on the building with colorful lights The ambience inside is amazing and is spread over two floors with the ground floor having the huge dance floor and pubs and a seating area upstairs The USP of the dance floor is the literally lit up chandelier made of LED rings grooving to the beat of the music also the walls have lights synced to this There is also an outdoor seating where you can watch your favorite matches and when bored head to the dance floor back indoor Coming to the Food Punjabi Paneer Tikka Rs Thick cubes of paneer marinated with mustard and curd base Was not soft and requires lot of improvement A strict no to this dish Burmese Rolls Rs A different kind of spring rolls filled with corn garlic and cheese The taste was delectable with the right balance of flavors and enhanced by the sweet chilli dip The only issue was not that crispy and a bit more oily Mains For the mains we had Exotic Vegetables in Black Pepper with Rice the curry was just ok had a decent flavor but didn t have the distinctive flavor of the pepper sauce in it Prism Special Veg Pizza The thin crust pizza loaded with cheese and topped with veggies like zucchini was the best main course that we had among the served The pizza was decent in taste had not much of marinara base but was not bland either The pizza was although not crispy as we got busy catching up the tricks performed by the bartenders Apart from these we were also served Veg Pulao and Meloni Tarkari curry which was completely average and to be skipped Drinks Cucumber Coriander Mocktail The cucumber coriander mocktail was too sweet The flavor of cucumber had dominated the slight tinge of coriander Go Crazy The blend of Oreo and chocolates was nothing out of the box and tasted like a regular chocolate shake Recommended Dishes Burmese Rolls Prism Pizza If you need a main course The place is highly average in terms of food despite being an ideal place to enjoy the night life So is not recommended Food Ambience VFM ,3.0,1

KS Bakers,A new place that slowly turned out into a hangout eatery for people with shallow pockets The lighting ambience is warm I love eating the chicken roll that hardly costs bucks A burger costs only Lot of University students depend on KS for a cheap dinner delivery You get free chips with everything you order But personally I felt the cheese they use is a bit weird about sweet for the taste of a traditional Pizza hut afficianado ,3.0,1

Hyper Local,Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly per person The place itself is located in a good open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer My experience with their food was decent The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle Dahi Vade Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe Speaking about their main course they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature Veg Hakka Noodles Red thai curry Chicken pizza Steamed Rice Chicken tikka Chicken wings and Chicken pockets Looking at the price of the drunch I feel a bit more items should have been on offer Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious However they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout The best part about the place was the drinks section Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail Sangria and Cranberry Cooler Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place All in all the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes Happy eating ,3.0,1

Pista House,Pista house s haleem is what I look forward to always On a vacation to Nizam s Hyderabad we thought we will try one of their chicken dishes and thus chose Dum ka Murg Tandoori roti A little above average food and overly filled staff who made it a little rushed up dining experience Didnt get time to breathe coz the staff kept coming to check on you No doubt thei service was prompt but at times felt it was too prompt They should give customers little time to breathe to order food and finish it with peace Next will try their haleem and some desserts too ,3.0,1

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Visited YYT with my family for Friday dinner Was longing to have Mandi for long The restaurant is located close to Q City amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall The d cor is simple yet beautiful Generous staff We ordered half chicken mandi and later an extra chicken piece it was more than sufficient needless to say it was heavenly Would love to try desserts from the menu specially baklawa Good place for get together Request the staff to maintain clean washrooms and dining seating area ,3.0,1
The Tilt Bar Republic,A chick place Went for a team lunch Service was very good with staff being courteous and prompt in serving food We opted for buffet which has decent number of options for both Vegetarian and Non vegeterians An ideal place to hangout with friends on a game night enjoying the drinks and food ,3.0,1

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sardarji s chaats and more is synonymous with the typical street food in Delhi and is nostalgia served in a plate all over for people who have for any point of time savored on the street food in delhi The sandwiches especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome The dahi bhalla dahi papdi s are good too However off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food Another complaint i had with them are their parathas they are bad polar opposite to their chaat dishes I would never recommend anyone ordering paratha s from this place and I tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked This is the reason I have rated them as out ,3.0,1
Frio Bistro,It was a funny experience there While the main course is quite satisfying the deserts were a total let down The ground floor could definitely do with some ventilation the fumes from the washroom will drive everyone away ,3.0,1
Behrouz Biryani,Ordered the much hyped about Behrouz biriyani today Wanted to have it since ages So today when the package came I was really thrilled The biriyani comes in a stunning package And as you open it the room fills with amazing Biriyani smells The biriyani was looks good with a lot of almonds and greens as garnishing on top The biriyani comes with raita and a gulab jamun too The biriyani is quite different from the other popular biriyani in Hyderabad This one is extremely sutle in taste The chicken was tender and was breaking apart easily The rice grains were staying apart and was expertly cooked Overall the biriyani was a really good experience But I personally prefer the spicy type when it comes to Biriyani but this biriyani is different and it is mouth wateringly delicious in a completely different way ,3.0,1
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Cascade is a luxury dining restaurant that falls under the notorious Carlson Group of Hotels and offers multi cuisine dishes The tremendous ambiance fully complements the canons of the place and instantly lightens up your mood into musical An addition to the offering is an elaborate buffet for foodies Cascade is in Gachibowli main road It s located on the second floor of the property While the lobby is inviting it only dispels all the doubts about the food being as inviting as the lobby As you enter Cascade you are greeted by a Buddha Statue As soon as you enter their food counter spread all over at the corner side we had a few veg and non veg salad sausage with spinach Started picking one of one and observed fish was stale and seems It was reused The chicken was hard and sausage was almost beginning to wring itself Actually none of the salads were any good partly because they weren t fresh something that is supposed to be figurative of a salad freshness Starters We had veg and non veg soups lots of breads naan roti kulchas Veg starters included paneer tikka potatoes veg mix fried Non veg included couple of chicken items and fish They had little variety of but not so tasty starters Anyway rushed towards main course Dal makhani which was waste Or in another word I was searching for Dal Makhani flavor And I feel in this level of restaurant at least Dal Makhani should be right Moved ahead and tried vegetable dum biryani with Mutton curry I must appreciate mutton curry was yummy and cooked properly but in the same dum biryani could be better For desserts it s a good mix of Indian including Hyderabadi bestseller Double Ka Meetha and European delicacies I am not much of a dessert being but was glad to see a large number of desserts in the buffet Overall I will not call it astonishing stuff but it has wonderful musical spacious place with decent ambiance but they need to improve food side a lot ,3.0,1
Tiki Shack,Ambience Music Staff Drinks Food Hit on wallet medium A super hit club of Jubilee Hills as per me is finding hard to live up to its reputation Standard Cocktails can be made better In food Nachoz is good but don t expect too much non veg in non veg nachos feels more like veg Achari murg is good and so is garlic bread Music is good and sometimes they bring in Dhol wala to up the spirit Cheers ,3.0,1

The Old Madras Baking Company,The Old Madras has been our go to place for some nice coffee with a sandwich whenever the weather is nice and you want to enjoy it sitting outdoor The coffee is quite good with a lot of variations available The best part is the freshly baked breads Those beautiful soft breads make the sandwiches all the more tasty when grilled with butter Even the puffs and Victoria cake are nice to have Coming to the worst part the service In all my visits over the past couple of months this has been the biggest turn off about this place Almost always I had to go to the counter to place the order instead of a waiter coming over Second would be the cleanliness of the outdoor seating More often than not you can see flies buzzing over the tables Though the kitchen looks quite hygienic ,3.0,1

Tandoori Food Works,Order regular paneer tikka briyani from this place which costs rs The briyani was good but the paneer was not so fresh and the quantity was very less It just fills one person stomach if someone s appetite is high then they would regret if they order food from this place There were two sizes small Rs and regular rs Obviously one would think that small fills one person and regular would fill two But No Very disappointed with the portion of food that they serve The Raitha was really tasty I hope they increase the portion for the amount they charge ,3.0,1
Hunger Maggi Point,I used to spot this shop opposite to the DLF IT park while coming back from work during my stay in Hyderabad Always crowded with majority of the IT people nearby and all other food delivery agents waiting to take parcel Got to know that they are also delivering till the wee hours of the night I was wanting to order from here once for that taste of Maggi Who doesn t like a fancy maggi noodles So one fine night ordered for a Corn Masala Cheese Butter Maggi through Zomato That was the most fanciest name I could find on their menu The delivery was smooth and the packing was okayish in a plastic box along with a plastic spoon and fork The maggi was somewhat soggy and some what semi gravyish which I am not that big a fan of It could have been a bit drier But the taste was really good and one could feel all the butter cheese in the maggi Good cost effective outlet for the love of Maggi Noodles ,3.0,1

Beyond Flavours,The reason for giving only a star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables We went on Friday afternoon We waited almost more than mins to get a table We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn t get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer ,3.0,1
Olive Garden,We ve been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since I am a big fan of starters So as soon as we reached the spot we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the Gachibowli area The interior was also tiny and seemed confined Anyhow we ordered chicken garlic chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant The staff were ok not quick but not rash though Even though they got our food very late they somehow tried to convince us with something non relatable situations Forgetting all that we just wanted to concentrate on our food As soon as we had our first bite the first thing that came to our mind was it s good but not great The flavour in the Biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices Overall it s a place where you can visit once in a while if you stay work near Gachibowli This is not a place to visit from a long distance Food Service Ambience Value for money Overall ,3.0,1

Arena Eleven,Experience at Arena Eleven Since it s in SLN Terminus mall it s not very difficult to find It was a Friday when we had dinner here and the experience it wasn t the best although it could be Place was packed by pm Definitely this place has the potential to improve and become better One big minus point is that on a Friday evening the washroom was out of order and I had to cross all SLN third floor to get to the toilet Ups that s really bad Ambiance is vibrant atmosphere is good but the music is too loud Usually I don t mind the music but here was really difficult to have a conversation They have screens and it s a good place to watch some sports There is some kind of terrace too and that s good till the hot summer Service was good regarding the waiters but really slow in bringing the food out from the kitchen They also have to change their menus or something because many items we tried to order weren t available like burgers pizza etc On a Friday evening pizza and burgers definitely will be ordered When it comes to the food we had enjoyed thoroughly some items but others were just average We had sizzling kebab platter Chipotle and jamaican chicken and lemon and pepper fish we choose Awesome kebabs Really juicy and tasty every each one of them We had sizzling mint biryani which also was delicious They didn t give any mirch ka salaan raitha or onion with the biryani just plain but I asked for some raitha and they brought Rice was flavoured and chicken was tender but just small pieces The let down were the rolls We had different types of rolls with fries and wedges Maximum average on quality and taste The price is on the expensive side but it still worth a try at least for the kebabs Food Ambiance Service Value ,3.0,1
10 Downing Street,A very mediocre experience to be honest at the outset I have been to the same restaurant in other cities and had great expectations The ambience is delightful and the three stars are only attributed to that It has a rooftop setting and a nice band was performing live Coming to food and service I would rate it We tried the jalape o cheese poppers horrible taste so much so we had to leave some of it We had the vegetarian pizza served burnt at the base On asking for a replacement the waiter says it might take a while to prepare a new one Only the lasagne was slightly upto the mark The service was literally horrible being a Sunday everyone was just chilling on their own I guess I would recommend you to try out other places and save a large pocket pinch by avoiding this place ,3.0,1

Shanghai Chef 2,Nothing could be better than having restaurant owner recieving you at entrance and assuring you of best service The restuarant is located on first floor having sufficiently spacious area with decent interiors appropriately giving a glimpse of typical Chinese restaurant Not to mention the love of colour red and yellow which found prominence here too I hereby got convinced to rate ambience and decor The crew was humble and the owner seemed delighted to have us After exchanging a few words he suggested us the best and quick food we could grab Owner and staff courtesy We first ordered talumein soup moderately spicy and filled with veggies which is certainly a healthy start We ordered mee gorang noodles comprised of lots of green and red chillies a perfect form of noodles to relish Recommended to those who are tired of shewzwan noodles Noodles accompanied with hot pot garlic gravy which Went with noodles so well except the excessive quantity of French beans that hindered the potential of dish ,3.0,1

Aromas@11SIX,This place is located in khajaguda It used to be one of my favorite places because of the taste quantity and pricing I used to visit this place every weekend or in fact twice a week Food is no doubt good their soups starters dal makhani etc However there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden Prices have been almost doubled I used to have a dal makhani at rs and now its priced at rs I believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost is really a good decision with no changes in ambience I believe their main USP was good food at affordable prices at a decent ambience Even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and Moti Mahal have lower prices and better ambience With hike in prices customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience fancy cutlery on the table well decorated tables and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use well dressed waiters etc Hope the management would rethink ,3.0,1

Dunkin' Donuts,To satisfy my donut craving stopped at this place Ordered some donuts and hazelnut iced coffee I d give a for the donuts as they were delicious but the hazelnut iced coffee was bad it was very diluted and tasted almost like flavored water I love their donuts but drinks should be made properly too please look towards it ,3.0,1

The Indi Grill,This restro is located in Gachibowli in The Platina building We headed to this place for dinner with team on Friday evening The place is good ambience wise and the stuff are friendly too The service was quick and they do ask you the reviews and suggestions Now coming to the food it was okay but as compared to other buffet kitchens like ABs or Barbeque Nation they still lag behind with the same price The starters were good in taste but the main course and dessert was ok ok ,3.0,1
Diners Pavilion,The food was not up to the mark The Mexican dish had too much chilli and Mexican rice was like Indian veg fried rice The Thai dish had strong flavours Overall did not like the food ,3.0,1
The Chocolate Room,Have been to The Chocolate Room at other locations so visit to this one was quite awaiting Like the ambiance and the aroma of hot chocolate that fills the restaurant A good place to date Definitely a little heavy on the pocket Staff is friendly We ordered Chicken cheese sandwich Chocolate walnut sundae Hot Hazelnut The staff needs to focus on hygiene there were cockroaches around the billing counter which was really disappointing we pointed the same to the staff The washroom was bad no tissues or hand wash ,3.0,1
The Chocolate Room,Sinful Nothing describes this place better Going through their super extensive menu would probably make you tired but the service is so appalling probably you ll die of hunger waiting for your order to arrive The place is cosy enough for you to carry a laptop and spend a couple hours on an assignment I d recommend you do that cause anyway they deliver orders after forever As the name goes I ve always had it in my mind to relate this place to a dessert bar And hence I ve never tried the savoury items offered here But I ve heard they have a good offering among sandwiches and nachos So that would keep my review limited only to the sweet dishes The Toblerone Shake and the Kitkat Shake are the shizzz So full of the taste actually well prepared The chocolate brownie is really a waste of money you ve probably had much better brownies all over Hyderabad Nutella Waffles and Death by Chocolate pancakes so good A heaven full of chocolate sauce and ice cream Make sure to hit the gym soon after P Slightly higher on the price point but worth a try ,3.0,1

Deli 9 Bistro,Have visited deli many times with good experiences but this particular time didn t have the same I ordered Singaporean prawns for starters As I was using Zomato gold the waiter insisted a place orders for both the dishes together which I haven t heard anywhere before After some question the waiter agreed The quantity of the prawns were underwhelming although the raat was good Then ordered chicken lasagna which is a safe bet here along with cold coffee Overall the service disappointed me but its a good shot for some good food,3.0,1
Beyond Flavours,We happened to go to this place on last sunday and it was mothers day and they had flat on the buffet meal for the mother which i really liked Needless to say the Ambience and music was really good We had a reservation but had to wait fir mins to get a seat They served us mango juice as wrlcome drink which tasted really good The buffet spread was one of a kind Strters Veg paneer tikka veg spring roll and veg cutlet They were lil cold but the taste wad good Non veg chicken kebab chicken manchurian and fish Fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot Chicken was fair enuf Singapore Noodles Egg salad and pasta They were good but it was cold Main course mutton rogan josh chicken tikka masala palak paneer All were equally good Biriyani Egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great Desserts moong dal halwa tasted really yumm ice cream gulab jamun cut fruits banana cake The staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slow We had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full They could improve the above points to stand better Overall ,3.0,1

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Great ambiance with very poor service Food The starters were just OK main course was a little better For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case What disappointed most was the drinks even a classic margarita was not properly made It was orange is color and that is definitely not OK Ambiance It definitely stands out for its ambiance Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants Service This is where it is most disappointing you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city Price It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved Overall would probably visit them again for the ambiance but with the hope that service improves ,3.0,1

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,An evening in THE Radisson itself is one it s kind And when the food is unlimited it s just bliss a heaven on earth We had booked a table via Nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality variety of dishes and a great ambience But somehow we don t know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it It is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that we don t know When I retrospect back home I thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there Not that they were rude but they didn t care much The manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us Well coming to the dishes we had a nice sumptuous dinner The best part was the dessert section If had a variety of spreads It was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes Oh boy I had a ball Had the staff had been a little attentive I d have rated an easy I guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the Nearbuy But we ve been too many star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently Taste Ambience Staff Value for money ,3.0,1

Driven Cafe,I love this place Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me Spacious evergreen english songs eg Nirvana Bryan Adams on the back ground It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit talk sip coffee enjoy the background songs not a noisy cafe like some other cafes This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city But the negative point is that they don t have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only star Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items ,3.0,1
Over The Moon Brew Company,Went here to catch up with a friend very near the ORR entrance and right beside the main road The interior was well done with the brewing machine at display which was the centre of attraction for most people visiting there The seating was plush and comfortable The choice of food was aplenty and the service was very prompt and homely The preparation and plating everything was about perfect but we did not liked the Lemon soda it had some weird taste In all it was good ,3.0,1
Eat India Company,This place has a good ambiance and is a treat for people wanting to take pictures but that s about it Went on a Sunday and there was no crowd at all The AC was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside The service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming Starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good the pace of refills needed to improve I honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course The stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that s about it It s expensive factoring in the food and service you get These guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment Could give it a try for the ambiance though ,3.0,1

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,This restaurant has its priorities straight Unlike AB s Flechazo and Barbeque Nation that swing for the fences and end up failing many times this place has hit a sweet balance between Hospitality and Taste Which means you have none of the irritating fake friendly over eager monkeys from the above mentioned places pushing and prodding you to try weird stuff even if you don t want to Instead you get a homely little corner where you can sit quietly and be left alone to mind your business until you order for something Very professional indeed The starters are awesome here they actually set the tone for the things to come This place features a wide range of delectable options for vegetarian diners as well which is a big step up from its competitors Kebabs are to die for Having said that the main meal was nothing to write home about They have tried a lot of things from Mughlai Intercontinental to Chinese but somehow these dishes don t come together on the plate But what actually took my heart away what this joint EXCELS in hands down compared to ANY FREAKING RESTAURANT IN THE CITY is the Desserts department For someone who loves sweets it s a psychedelic experience The variety and taste will haunt you for days The desserts are neither too sweet nor too rich Just the type that the northern crowd will go berserk about I was thoroughly satisfied and if you leave out the clove heavy gravy of mutton and the generic dishes of the main menu then the place is a RockaRolla discovery Definitely worth one visit and then the count will just keep on ticking ,3.0,1
Cafe Eclat,The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool But we were in for huge disappointments They have too vast a menu for them to handle Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago We ordered their self recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just small chicken drumsticks paired with different salty sauces The plate had barely bites of chicken but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken This at a cost of Rs was completely unreasonable for me The chicken and mushroom soup was good but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago Coffee was ok pretty much standard as everywhere else All in all hugely disappointed with the promises of FRESH and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing ,3.0,1

Hyderabadi Daawat,Looking at the overall rating the close promixity to our office visited this place for lunch along with my team today Looks like this place is mainly for IT people as most of it is occupied by batches Nothing great to say about the interiors ambiance it is decent enough I am the odd man out in the group being the only vegetarian but will put in words what my colleagues said about the non veg food Veg Not that great we ordered Panneer tikka palak sheek kebab for starters Sabzi Nawabi Handi butter naan for mains Panneer is rubbery not soft indicating it is not fresh Palak sheek kebab is kind of bland with no taste not cooked properly As suggested by the staff we opted for Sabzi Nawabi Handi which is a bad decision as the taste is not that good Service wise they took lot of time in getting our order which is a let down as well Non veg Sikendari Raan is a standout dish whereas the other Murg Musallam is bland with no taste spiceness to it Same is the case with Yakhni Shorba which tasted like hot gravy water Overall I would not suggest anyone to visit this place considering the inconsistency in the food they served along with bad service ,3.0,1

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Having heard a lot about this place and my curiosity to try a new cuisine that s a part of India but different from the other usual cuisines led me and a bunch of my friends to Zing s for dinner First up we were greeted with a distinct smell of raw pork which was mildly unpleasant The starters were quite good spicy chicken momos and the pork preparations pork belly and some kind of chilly fried pork The main course however was disappointing or perhaps we expected something else The Ramyum noodles tasted like a bland version of Top Ramen and the noodles had a strange texture to them There was not enough broth either which you tend to expect from any kind of ramen noodles The Teriyaki chicken rice was a tad too sweet for my palette personally The best thing would be the prices everything is so resonably priced it s not easy to find non veg especially pork beef etc at these prices One major area of feedback would be the service They have an extremely laidback dont really care attitude and it took a bit of effort for us to get their attention and get them to the table each time A little more effort from the management and they could be do loads better than they are currently maybe even start a franchise Value for money Service Ambience Overall ,3.0,1
10 Downing Street,A grand entry decent ambience and average food That just about sums it up for Downing Street Just as the name suggests the place has a very British feel to it as far as the ambience goes It s cost warm and has great layout But the layout proves to be a negative as well We went here for lunch and the place was very loud The good point was that we got a great seat with excellent view The service was decent but one of the dishes we ordered did not arrive I hope they write down what was ordered The food itself was good We had chicken wings chicken Tikka seekh kabab tandoori veg platter and drinks The food was good and arrived a tad slow Overall it is a good place to have a drink and be merry ,3.0,1

Pot Pourri,So I met my brother here for lunch yesterday We ordered spring rolls kaju paneer curry and butter naans The best amongst the order was the starter The curry was just okay with strong turmeric after taste The breads we ordered also arrived cold which made them difficult to chew Overall just an average experience Would have enjoyed if the naans were better and the curry didn t have so much turmeric in it ,3.0,1

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,A little understaffed when I visited on a Friday evening and while the food lived up to its usual great standards I was kind of bummed out that all of their salads and their spinach and mushroom dumplings were unavailable I have not been able to order a salad in the or times I have been here Kudos to the team for their effort nonetheless I know it was a busy night for a small person service team ,3.0,1

Prism Club & Kitchen,Prism is touted to be the owner of a huge club space and rightly so The place is located somewhere in Financial District after you take a turn from the Lemon Tree hotel I pretty much had no clue about where I was exactly and the almost stranded road is of not much help Until you suddenly see the big lit up sign with the word Prism inscribed on it though conveniently covered by the bushes around it Another m or so you reach their parking yard and finally the enter the premises after it A huge velvety door opens into this big sized covered arena for a lack of better word that tell you that it can never get overcrowded on the dance floor The place has high tables next to the dance area and then some couches on the far side There is a beautifully lit up staircase that leads to a more relaxed lounge kind of seating And that is just one part of it They have an outdoor seating where the projector is put up for the match screening and doubles up as the smoking zone Apart from this they have a pool which would be apt for a private gathering I am no club expert but their light system is sure one of their USP The DJ played majorly Bollywood that evening it was a Wednesday and did a decent enough job While the place is all decked up pretty well the food on offer didn t impress me much STARTERS Burmese Roll with sweet chilli dip A bit too oily they were okay to munch on They could have done with a bit more filling though Punjabi Paneer Tikka with mint dip Failed to impress The paneer was too rubbery in some places and in others too charred The lingering taste was merely of chilli and nothing else MAINS Prism Special Veggie Lover Pizza The dish that fared best with me It was thin crust and had a good amount of cheese For the price it may seem a bit costly but quite worth it as compared to other dishes Spaghetti Their take of spaghetti aglio olio with mushrooms and black olive toppings This was also decent Penne Alfredo This was just regular nothing good or bad And this also goes for the accompanying garlic bread I didn t find the Indian mains anything great and needs to be improved a lot The dessert was another downer Chocolate Truffle was all goey and just cream From the mocktails section I chose the safest bet Go Crazy It was a twist on the oreo shake with the inclusion of KitKat but it wasn t great either Lacked the comfort of a regular oreo shake If you are looking for a party place that has a happening setup good crowd and amazing ambience this is your best bet But for the food it is better you stick with safe bets such as pizzas and pastas They would give you the best value for money The alcohol is also a little pricey but you wouldn t mind that in a place like this ,3.0,1

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Hello everyone We visited this place a few days back and tried their buffet We were not happy with the quality of food served The variation was good enough There were veg as well as non veg starters The main course also had veg and non veg dishes each But the taste was not at all satisfying We expect this place will improve in future If what you read is in any way helpful for you do like the review and follow us We would be happy to bring in honest reviews about different restaurants all across India ,3.0,1
Gal Punjab Di,I visited this place with my friend It is there right in the heart of Gachibowli s Indiranagar vinayak nagar Upon entering you will definitely feel good and like a family restaurant which it is The ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off There are some corner sittings which many may or may not like and then there were chairs where fitting in was a bit tight Then comes the interaction with the staff They are quite friendly and hard working too They do have a quick serving time but thing is their attire was not up to the mark Menu had a wide variety of items and at some decent rates I really liked the way they split between veg and non veg food We ordered quite a lot of stuff but I really liked the dahi kebab It was good But with such good starter I had pinned my hopes on Patiala lassi But that was an anti climax of sorts They used essence for the lassi I hope they start making more authentic lassi with a malai on top That will surely be a game changer Overall it was a mixed experience and hence ,3.0,1

Club Rogue,The music here is too loud even for a club You can t hear what other person is saying even if they are speaking in your ear Ambience is cool Food is okay I think the good thing about this place is that price is a bit low compared to similar places And because of ladies night almost every day of week you will never find the place dull and empty even on weekdays Also I feel the dance floor lighting is bit too bright for my liking ,3.0,1
Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Green bawarchi is a most familiar restaurant in Hyderabad They spread over Hyderabad You will find any green bawarchi near your area Coming to this like all green bawarchi restaurants they have crowd for taken away customers We had take many times Coming to dine here It s like any normal restaurant with basic interiors We have to wait mins after order something We had grilled chicken butter chicken butter naan rumali roti and chicken biryani I like their chutney which comes with chicken Biryani was nice but little spicy Roti and butter naan both were fine Pocket friendly We can go with family and friends Food Ambience Service Value for money Overall an option to have food according to your convenience ,3.0,1
