Zing's Northeast Kitchen,We wouldn t have found this gem of a place if we hadn t been at the mall opposite and looking for a place to have lunch More than a month since we visited but it was such a treat The place is tiny right on the road but still can be missed out if you are not looking for it The menu is pretty extensive but going by our love for pork we dove right into the traditional pork dishes on offer We ordered Soba noodles with pork and veggies Naga Pork curry which came with rice and then added some smoked fried pork with bamboo shoots The noodles were alright but had sort of a maggi consistency but there was enough pork to enhance the flavor The naga pork curry was a revelation spicy but so full of flavor my daughter who is averse to spices ate a fair bit The fried pork was delicious too but an overkill going by how we were already full with the first two dishes We had ordered the flavored beer they have which was refreshing but relatively overpriced But just for the food I think we need to visit again Highly recommended for the cuisine they have on offer ,4.0,2

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,I went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon Four of us were there for lunch out of four two of us opted for the sunday brunch and the other two went for la carte I was among the two who went for la carte For the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band The ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded they offer open air seating as well The starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor Personally I felt the seating isn t much comfortable as the chairs backrest lacked comfort The air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside wasn t as comfortable as I expected it to be However the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can Coming to the food I had ordered Mutton Sukha Rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns My companions went for the sunday brunch as they told me the non vegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless All the starters were very well balanced in flavour the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite Compared to the starters the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing Prawn cocktail was outstanding the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet Coming to the la carte menu the Mutton Sukha was great in every way the spices were perfectly balanced they weren t overpowering the flavour of the meat it s definitely a must try there The rib eye steak didn t impress me much the meat wasn t juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing On the other hand the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant they were served on a bed of saut d spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour Overall it s a great place to visit which serves dishes from all the major cuisines around the world ,4.0,2
Labonel,A true match for Theo s from Mumbai one of Hyderabad s finest bakery The Triple Chocolate Cake is just designed and made to perfection The cake is soft and gooey full of chocolate and provided in amazing packaging I ve been a regular with their brownies they re super light and yet so tasty The only negative is that they come in a box of around 15 pieces as the smallest offering The cupcakes are a delight as well both red velvet and chocolate Slightly high on the price point Always a go to place for an excellent experience ,5.0,2

Beyond Flavours,My review of the place comes after multiple visits that have spanned over 4 months And now I can safely say that it s one of the good places around They re located near the Biodiversity signal above Fabindia There s ample parking for both two and four wheelers The ambience is a bit dim after dark and the seating is divided into various options including a PDR section The menu design is in the shape of a bottle and the array spans Continental Chinese and Indian cuisines Here s the list of things that I have tried across all my visits Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks Cheese sticks that are coated and fried Pure cheese bliss Veg Lasagna This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels The usual favourite this one has a slightly different presentation here Makhmali Paneer Tikka Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler Italian Nachos Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese and baked in the dish Cheese and Cheese Pizza Soft base pizza loaded with cheese and a few pieces of green olives I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here I have also tried out their lunch buffet The variety may not be as elaborate as other places but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings it is at least a one time try But what I really adore here is their mocktails Beyond Delight is an absolute delight Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks The staff is ever so courteous A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro who were our attendants on the latest visit The place has Zomato Gold 1 1 which further brings down their reasonable rates A meal for two would roughly be around 700 that fills not only your tummy but also you heart ,4.0,2

Aromas@11SIX,This review was long due Located on the Khajaguda Road this restaurant claims to be part of the Gachibowli cluster and when I asked the owner he said he was just on the edge of Gachibowli and therefore technically they are in Gachibowli The place has good parking and nice natural setup which has still been maintained despite the recent road construction Coming to the food we went for the Gulaabi Chaap after checking on Google unfortunately this is the only place in India that offers this dish and we had no clue about the dish until we got it Simply put it was amazing mild rose smelling chicken cooked in the tandoor and served with mint sauce It gave a heavenly feeling Next on the list was the Chicken Momo which was soft and fresh again reminded me of some amazing momos I had in Manali I hope some day they make Mutton Momos as well Butter Chicken was by far the best in town which went very well with another amazing bread called the Malai Warki Paratha It was soft and was melting in the mouth with the Butter Chicken Seemed like a match made in heaven Much said about the main course we went for their version of Special Biryani As is known from my reviews I don t eat too spicy food and this was just the perfect spicy level one could ask for It had boneless pieces of chicken pan fried and served on top of the Biryani Rice The taste was good and to my liking Our Vegetarians friends were enjoying their Daal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala which was again good and their Veg Biryani as per them was equally good Thanks to the friendly staff we went on eating for close to 2 and half hours without feeling the time passing by The large projector added to the aura of the place and we enjoyed the IPL on the large screen They offered us a 20 discount and another 10 on our next visit apparently one of their limited time running offer Thank you aromas 11six for being such a good host and an amazing food We shall be back again ,5.0,2

NorFest - The Dhaba, This has to be my favourite Punjabi restaurant in Hyderabad During my short trip in Hyderabad I have tried food in many restaurants but this one was a scene stealer What I liked the most abt this place was the amazing food at such a reasonable price The taste was something that will crave you to have more and more even when you are full I visited this place with my friend without any proper planning our intention was to visit the pub in the same mall but we were too hungry and were not interested in eating in pub We wanted something heavy to get that energy to dance like crazy So we ended up in this restaurant It is located at the food court and has open seating facility We ordered the Punjabi Special VegThali 269 It was the most delicious Thali I ever had in life just divine and out of the world It comprises of the following Kadai Paneer 4 5 5 Paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste I have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy But this one has the most tasty and delicious gravy Dum aloo 4 5 This was the veg of the day potatoes were peeled properly and were marinated nicely Just like paneer the gravy was something to lure for Dal Makhani 4 5 5 A Punjabi Thali is definitely incomplete without a Dal Makhani It is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had Bundi Raita 5 5 This one stole my heart I think words won t do justice for its great taste I never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me I eat out a lot I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour A big thumbs up for this dish Rice 4 5 The zeera basmati rice was definitely of the best quality It was big in size and was cooked so well Each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own Butter Tandoori Roti 4 5 It was soft buttery and definitely only made up of wheat without any hint of maida Salad 4 5 5 Fresh cucumber carrot and onion with a pinch of lemon is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali Kheer 4 5 The perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer It was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone The service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins What I like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy The quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it But I will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty you will regret sharing even a single bite Surely try this outlet and you will thank me later Final Verdict Food 5 Ambience 3 Service 4 Value for money 5 Overall Rating ,4.0,2

Driven Cafe,Super fancy ambience and cost but totally not worth the hype We ordered Mint mocha which tasted OK Chocolate bomb tasted like crushed oreos with butter and meagre amount of chocolate Mushroom sandwich overpriced for this ccd type sandwiche coffee crunch it was good because I like chocolate and coffee combo But for the price the drink itself not that rich Few good points vegetarian cafe good location good music they buzz you when your food s ready All I can say is and I am saying this because I believe that everything can get better if you put effort Driven Cafe dont drive us away with your bad food We dont mind paying a bomb if the food is excellent And your selling point is NOT the Ambience You dont have a selling point if your quality of food is so low There s so much competition out there you have to rev up your game Serve good food and bring your reputation up Challenge accepted ,2.0,0

Al Saba Restaurant,The classic example of what happens when all aspects of a restaurant are not taken care of When your service doesnt compliment the food one serves it sometimes leads to disaster Walked in on early lunch and had a tough time asking the waiters to temp down the ac for they have been keeping it at 17 degrees Agreed the influx of customers at lunch demands that but the early birds shouldnt have to suffer because of that Ordered a variety of dishes only to find out fish is not available The service time was also too much I found the waiters to be a little rude I can sense their awkwardness in serving to an Odia table themselves being odia Neways now coming on to the food The chicken biriyani does taste good as far as Hyderabadi Biriyani is considered Other items such as mutton biriyani paneer masala and dal were also good Its a one time visit restaurant but if the restaurant has to give a tough time to counterparts in Gachibowli it has a long way to go Taste 3 Service 2 Ambience 2 Value For Money 2,2.5,0

Club Rogue,I am thinking where to start there were so many bad experiences at this place in just 2 3 hours of time we spent there We were a group of 8 we decided upon this place after looking at the reviews and on recommendation of someone who had visited a few months before us To start with the place does not have well groomed and professional staff they hardly understand what you speak The first bad experience was when we entered and got ourselves seated on a large table meant for 10 we were 6 at that time and 2 more expected to join us As soon as we got seated a waiter came to us and asked us to take a smaller table as this one is meant for 10 people we told him that we are expecting 2 more to join shortly but he insisted we take a smaller table as crowd would start coming it was not even 6 PM then and there was hardly anyone at that time other than the 6 of us We told him that incase more crowd comes we will move Secondly we ordered for drinks and those were served in plastic glasses when we asked for glass ones the waiter they don t have any We had to literally fight for glass tumblers and they did it very reluctantly The service was slow we had to keep looking for waiters We were there during happy hours and were told it ends at 7 PM but the waiters stopped taking orders at 6 50 PM saying by they serve it would cross 7 PM Doesn t that sound ridiculous Again they started serving in plastic glasses and we were demanding the glass ones when the argument was not stopping I suggested my friends that we should go to 10D to which the waiter present said we should go to 10D they use glass tumblers after he said that we demanded meeting the Manager The Manager came and he was a nightmare he did not have the courtesy to apologize on behalf of the waiter and started arguing with us when we said we will give bad rating review the Manager said Ok Sir we are also dangerous people we were shocked at this Our evening was spoilt already so we decided to move out of there and go elsewhere This place is not at all professional the staff and their business ethics are horrible will never visit ever ,1.0,0

Shanghai Chef 2,The Overall Rating present for this restaurant doesn t justice the experience will come to this in a bit So a small almost cute little place tucked in first floor with ambient lightings turned on to give romantic dinner table feel and apt audible english chartbusters couldn t go any wrong with setup and restaurant proudly own this With this as a beginning shanghai chef takes the dinning experience to whole new diff level which is confusing at its best Waiters are surely not in the mood to offer appropriate tables to guests not aware of all the food which is getting prepared in kitchen not aware of all the Must Try dishes of their own menu most of all courtesy seems to have been left at the mercy of the servers Like an example since its not a fine dining we can t expect servers to serve your food left in the bowl again but same server at one table doing the same thing neglecting other tables left too much to be desired This was the case when a cockroach was found in one of the guests food and staff tried to avoid the scene blaming it to fate On the food side crispy corn was good but avoid maonchow soup Flat noodles also served just warm that too after enquiring multiple times Also Service takes the beating even if just half tables are filled So coming back to first line The rating is probably for food only go at your own risk if your are looking for experience ,2.0,0

Momos Delight,So on one of the weeknite i craved for momos Most of the delivery points were closed except this So thot to give it a try Delivery was delayed and that made me lil upset I ordered two things Veg steamed momos and chicken steamed momos Veg steamed momos The packaging was real bad and u cud see momos out of the silver foil box The filling of the momo wasnt really pleasing and was not tasty enuf to swat my mood The veggies seemed to be over burnt and they didnt smell good either The schezwan chutney that they usually setve with momos was more lookinglike tomato ketchup and the quantity was so lil that it cud just suffice 1 momo Chichen steamed momo All of the above applies though the chicken smelled as if it was day old Highly disappointing 2stars just for the zomato valet ,2.0,0
The Tilt Bar Republic,The ambience was good The service was way too slow and the staff was busy watching the cricket match on TV I guess The food was below average One of the server didn t inform what we have ordered for pepper chicken and later the person who took the order in the starting came and he was telling that we did not order after 15 minutes of telling the other server Such a poor coordination and very slow service Not at all worth the price ,1.0,0

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Writing this review for so called much hyped restaurant of Hyderabad Jonathan s kitchen Went to celebrate my bday today It was the worst food buffet I ever had in any above average costly restaurant They charge so high for this shitty buffet 1 Ambience Even a local resaturant also have some areas of decoration in their restaurant but they have it like a messy hall No theme no decoration 2 Service No serving of starters no serving of even water until u ask no serving of even sauce at your table and waters think themself like heroes here 3 Food The worst part of it Some stale starters of chicken and fish Veg ones you cant even chew corn items as they might be few days old One chicken starter only had some taste Main course is also pretty below average Pasta is good Pizza so called best Hyderabadi pizza was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza Deserts they put some sweets of local shops as deserts Two juices as welcome drinks were Ok I gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bday Thanks for that They themself agreed that their lunch buffets are generally not that great we should try a la carte Will do that if I will ever try to take this risk again ,2.0,0

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,This outlet has been secluded from the limelight of the Kondapur gachibowli stretch but still manages to garner a decent amount of crowd The ambiance is pretty ambivalent with that of a buffet restaurant and casual dining space It was well lit but could really deck up a few notches It was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant Upon arrival were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation We were asked if we are here for buffet The restaurant it seems is more concentrated on buffet I had a look at the menu and it didn t interest me The manager at this place was a nice fellow Who carefully took our order of dragon chicken punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan After a fair bit of waiting time we re served with dragon chicken I would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry so that the flavours stick to the chicken It was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation The servers need to be taught a little bit about serving They were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers Then we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan Simply put it was a disaster The curry was as bland as it could be Most restaurants in this part of India assume that all dishes of Punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief We could only experience the tandoori chicken as the curry had no taste of its own It was just sitting there doing nothing Neither it was spicy not it was tangy It was going nowhere The problem here doesn t lie with the chefs It lies with the restaurant which is confused in what they are trying to do They say they are multi cuisine but multi cuisine doesn t mean you can make disaster dishes and pass them off I am not a fan of multi cuisine When you have such a title you should at least try to make it work for you The restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant North Indian population or the traditional South Indian population One thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their Buffet menu They tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion Had the restaurant been a traditional southern one I would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content The restaurant needs to find its footing The owners need to decide which way they want to go Maybe hire some traditional North Indian guys for North cuisine Ambience 3 Taste 2 Service 2 Value for money 2,2.0,0

Shanghai Chef 2,This place has lost its charm Went for dinner today Ordered honey crispy chicken and butter garlic prawns They served honey crispy chicken was waiting for butter garlic prawns After 40 minutes the person comes and asks for main course order I asked for butter garlic prawns he comes back after 5 minutes and says it s not available Pathetic service they take almost an hour to tell you if a order is available or not Better avoid it if these are the standards of this place wasting customers time,1.0,0

Prism Club & Kitchen,Such a pathetic experience I had in this place First I called them on their number to check if it is open at 6 PM on a Sunday The person who received call on behave of Prism stated that it is open from 6 PM Once we reach there by 6 30 PM no staff was ready to respond and said who told you it is open now The way they spoke to their customer is really annoying I Don t know to whom you have called and taken the confirmation about the open hours but as you came early I am considering you and giving a table Is this how low they treat a customer Secondly When requested for a good seat as there is no crowd available The manager or a person with attitude told us No there are no seats available In a bold manner When I checked from Zomato there are plenty of tables available I got pinched with irritation Though I felt the lighting is good and order for drinks to my friends Finally Me and my friends were feeling uncomfortable with the way people treating their customer And then mosquitoes came into picture There are full of mosquitoes hissing around our heads and of course no AC has turned ON Out of frustration we tried cancelling the food that was ordered by us and everything we ordered They said it is not possible to cancel the order and your order will be here in 20 minutes I was like WTF I asked for cheque and paid the bill without having anything and left the place Such a disappointing experience it was I suggest do not visit this place where customers are not treated well ,1.0,0

Chinese Pavilion, Delayedpost date of visit Jan 10 FoodShaukeen ChinesePavilion Chinese Pavilion was one place which was hiding in my wishlist for very long in Chinese category and this wish was fulfilled when a friend wanted to throw a party in a Chinese restaurant and I wasted no time in suggesting this Visited Gachibowli branch which is above CCD and is in the same building of Up the Bistro Their ambience does comply with their cuisine to most and their seating is quite comfortable and can seat up to 40 pax comfortably Pricing is a bit on higher end with most of the dishes are priced above 350 and very few are between 250 350 A tummyful meal could go up to 1400 for 2 AI Have ordered Manchow soup to start our meal which satisfied our taste buds Red Chilli Prawns dry BBQ chicken three treasure veggies and honey glazed potato balls were part of appetizers Prawns Teppan yaki pan fried and tossed along with Chilli Garlic and butter tasted real good BBQ chicken was a decent attempt and could have been more better Show stealer among appetizers was definitely honey glazed potato balls which were delicious with a punch of sweet and a little pepperish a wonderful combo to your taste buds Three treasure veggies had broccoli baby corn and mushrooms and felt more like a salad for me Had it been a little more pan fried with its sauces could have done wonders Among main course was schezwan fried rice and CP special noodles which is made of pan fried noodles and oyster sauce tasted Okish as sauce did not impress me as much as I expected Schezwan rice was delicious though right to the spices Requested for desserts and they dint have anything from their menu except honey noodles Service Though their service is quick staff is not so attentive to the customer for the ad hoc requests and also to take order Something that is important from customer point of view Bottomline there were few misses and few hits However most of the dishes were towards sweeter side I wouldnt mind another try here and see if my first visit is just an exception ,3.5,0

Club Rogue,The worst place in the city I was here for a few drinks with my friends and it was during the happy hours which is till 6pm and they were so adamant in taking our order at 5 50 stating happy hours were closed we had to literally tell them that we were still in happy hours to ask for that price surprisingly they didn t like it and the drinks were diluted What surprised me the most was that they were serving everything in plastic glasses Like seriously Serve drinks in a plastic glass When speaking to the waiter he said go to 10D they serve drinks in glasses and not plastic it was so rude for him to say that I asked him to call his manager and told him the story to which he says his boss asked to serve in plastic glasses and kept explaining that it was his boss s order he was just not able to understand what I was explaining to him I bigger issue was about the way the waiter had spoken to me and when even after sometime I realised he was not interested in what I was saying I was furious and used F word to which he said you can use F word but we are also very dangerous people Like what dangerous He was absolutely okay with me writing this review as they felt they didn t have any obligation towards customer service It was not something they were giving me for free and to compensate he was willing to give me discount and also call the waiter to apologies to me I didn t need someone s apology what matters the most is their service and looks like it does not appear anywhere on their list of how to sustain in the business Disappointed ,1.0,0

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Komatose on a Sunday night is the perfect place to be happened to be drizzling which made for the perfect atmosphere to chill outside in the cabanas Inside was a pretty small area for a bar but had loads of seating space which extended out to a floor above overlooking the area below Lighting was funky and great the vibrant colors adding to the vibe Being a big bunch we ordered different drinks and luckily I got to taste all The most special of these were from the 7 deadly sins of Koma menu The taste was as described on the menu Lust in particular was something different I d never tasted before a chilli spiced vodka strawberry infusion The appetizers we had we re really good something I enjoyed more than the alcohol Dragon prawns Grilled pomfret Peshawar Chapali Kebabs are some of the must orders Didn t quite like the Nawabi Shikhampuri While all the items tasted great I felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price Best for the last not being a kid here but the mocktails were just mind blowing Had a few different fruit flavors peach mango green apple lime out of which the peach was the best Multiple rounds of that gave me the sugar rush The service was professional and quick Would ve wished for better music and there was no DJ at the music station However we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great It s a perfect place to watch a match screening have a party or if you re in the mood for it go into Comatose Here s my overall SCORE Food 3 5 5 Ambience 3 5 5 VFM 3 5 5 Service 3 5 5,3.5,0

Prism Club & Kitchen,The new place in the financial district which everyone is talking about and is known for its dance floor as its USP I went here with my team on Friday night and booked upper deck for the same The place no doubt is very spacious and has one of the best dance floors in Hyderabad The light system and other props were good It reminded me of Club Octagon in Gangnam Seoul Overall ambience is good with 2 levels of seating where ground floor can is suitable for small groups or couples and upper deck has sofa sets for bigger groups Food is just average here Starters like paneer tikka baby corn or chicken tikka were very greasy Main course was also not upto the mark Worst thing I experienced about this place is the service I asked person attending us to start the main course at 8 30 pm To which he replied it will take another half an hour to get the main course ready It would have been fine if main course got started at the said time but after many more follow ups it started at 10 pm This really pissed me off and ruined whole experience I wanted to give 1 star but giving it 2 just because of ambience Food 2 5 Service 1 Ambience 4,2.0,0

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,We went here for 31st 2018 Evening after reserving table for 3 They told us there will be 500 entry charge per person but that wont be a coupon inside to get anything So it was 1500 for us 3 and food drinks charges being seperate We saw the menu rates online and felt it to be fine When we went there for entry as they told 1500 we had to pay and that too they said they will only take cash 1500 Cards will be accepted inside but not accepted to take it for entry fee We always keep cards mostly luckily we had that much cash paid and went inside Got a table for 4 for us 3 So like first mistake of staff when ordered a Mojito Mocktail as I dont drink and they instead of Mocktail send a Cocktail Alcoholic Drink Second mistake of staff as we are purely vegetarians in beginning itself we mentioned that and ordered a paneer starter and some crispy potato starter And they came and served Non Veg starter After complaining about this both to staff they apologised and said it won t repeat Now when we repeated our starter and ordered crispy potato again AGAIN for the 3rd time they sent incorrect order and a Non Veg Starter again to us I complained to Manager and he said sorry and staff said sorry but they didnt even had courtesy to make it up to their 3 huge mistakes back to back by any discounts which they could do LEAST Not that I asked for any but that was courtesy on their side So when all this wrong orders were going on in between of that we were asked to adjust on the seat of 2 and they made other people sit on our table across us even after reserving table and paying for it Ok and the last thing the DJ mostly 70 of time was playing VERY OLD SONGS which I again didn t enjoy Oh yes and forgot to mention that they had increased prices on drinks and all food and had a whole seperate new menu for 31st December 2018 with increased prices ,1.0,0

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,As the name suggests its supposed to be a Marriott and that s what you expect The reality is very different Let s start with my experience even before reaching I was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool And so I did I was denied reservation saying that it s really full but they finally said they can get me one table I was happy It has a separate entrance in SLN terminus with it s own parking and valet which is real comfortable Now let s talk real business Upon Reaching I see the place completely empty Maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty I didn t understand why they had to do play so hard to get Even by the time we left the place was hardly even half full The whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside Ambience the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest It s very mediocre Staff THE WORST SERVICE EVER I have had better service in small restaurants or even small Dhabas if I may compare them I had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come There is an inside seating and outside we took the inside because it was too noisy out I asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me Andar koi nahi baithta No one sits inside If you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open There was a buffet and we went for it now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there We had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to Being a Marriott you d expect some decent service they said if I m paying with card I have to come to the billing counter and pay there Such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel Food There was hair in the food Starters were okay but main course was very bad And let me make special note of the dessert If I m coming for a buffet in such a place I d expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop They bought kaaju kathli Rasgulla Some barfi among some cake etc And no spoons to take them had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert Next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view I ve attached pictures After paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went When we tried to Express our grief that waiter manager just blatantly shut me off I m not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place It was the most disappointing experience I ever had in Hyderabad Marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property I will for sure NEVER come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here ,1.0,0

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,The most horrible and disgusting place I have ever been to They have a big menu to offer but most of it is not available to be served The food is the shittiest thing ever made and eaten in human history The waiters are rude and incompetent to either understand hindi or English The acoustics in the karaoke nights sucks When we asked for a manger three different waiters came to us and finally when we said we won t pay the bill until the manager addresses our concerns is when the amazing pot bellied arrogant and rude manager showed up His name is Ali and he was in no mood to listen to any of the feedback we provided instead he offered as 2 free drinks which we definitely didn t need because somewhere he already agreed with the feedback we gave but he didn t want to do anything about it When I tried explaining him that we would pay the bill add tip and don t want free drinks but we want him to take the feedback seriously he was like if u r leaving leave why are u wasting my time I lost it and I was telling my friend I repeat I was talking to my friend stating what the fuck is wrong with this place is when he interrupts me and says that I need to mind my language I was like WHAT I am talking to my friend about the place What s your problem in that And I literally said sorry even joined my hands for forgiveness to which he replies staying ye badtameez ladkia yaha aati he kyu hai tmko jo karna hai karlo ladkiya he ho na kya ukhaadlogi UKHAAD lo So that pretty much defines this place the food and the people Don t be a fool to visit this place even after reading my review But yeah if u think u can reach Ali a nice lesson please go ahead all my blessings are with you ,1.0,0

Pot Pourri, Writing this review as soon as I got out of the restaurant From the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience Left right after starters I wouldn t even care to rate it one star One of worst restaurants to dine in I think it ll be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more the After reaching at 2 PM there was no receptionist After the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people It was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged That s it A piece of advise to y all if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there Neither proper AC chambers nor proper cooling It was HOT Thanks POT POURRI for understanding and making our dining uncomfortable After we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we re opting for veg or non veg By this time I was already wondering if they thought we re idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want I just realised that it was true After soup and buttermilk starters were served PAINFULLY SLOW It took MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR THEM TO FINISH SERVING JUST 6 STARTERS Were they kidding me They wasted my precious time and this isn t what a customer wants If you can t give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere We had to school the waiters regarding their service then we spoke to their leader I guess and he also gave the same old typical answer sorry I ll just get that served for you We don t want no sorry You can t placate us with sorry for our time hard work and money spent After seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to sorrys I decided to leave the restaurant After all this HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE US THE COMPLETE BILL It was 1100 It wasn t even worth it even if we had the whole menu After arguing he decided to give 10 discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we had Wouldn t suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant Starters I found the starters to be normal good in quality Not very impressive nor was menu standing out If you pay 100 200 more you ll be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food 1 Soup we were served chicken soup It wasn t impressive It was fine 2 Buttermilk under drinks it was tasty 3 Chicken tikka it was ok It was hard sometimes soft 4 Ajwani paneer tikka it was very good in taste 5 Kodi vepudu it was chicken with common known marination I mean it felt like typical Indian curry It was just good 6 Fried veg green chilli it was just ok in taste Couldn t make out if it s actually chilly 7 Corn fried fish it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste Probably this is the only best thing there 8 Crispy corn corn was crispy as expected and tasted good Main course I found it to be typically common Nothing new if you ve been to buffets before Accompaniments were regular papad curd naan roti Desserts not much varieties What s there is menu is served Ambience I don t care about ambience as long as food is good and my patience isn t tested ,1.0,0

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,A little understaffed when I visited on a Friday evening and while the food lived up to its usual great standards I was kind of bummed out that all of their salads and their spinach and mushroom dumplings were unavailable I have not been able to order a salad in the 4 or 5 times I have been here Kudos to the team for their effort nonetheless I know it was a busy night for a small 2 person service team ,3.0,1
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,It was a night out with gal pals When we entered the server took us to our sitting area we chose a corner as it had a couch felt it was bit secluded Warm indoors black and brown seatings cartoons of laal street their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the TV They have their own app for ordering but guess what their wifi wasn t available as it was under repair That is what server told us The server came and took our orders We ordered starters and drinks As soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere It kind of scared us then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation Then we started enjoying the music and our orders came The server got one of the drinks wrong we reminded him it was changed he said he already brought this Other places the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast Instead he said he cant take it back Anyways moving on The cocktail which i had were really good The cosmopolitan Beer trap and Screw driver The starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian Italian cheese fingers They were crispy and yum Stuffed mushrooms they were okay and forgettable the Nachos were okay have had better ones The crispy corn was good Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters The music was good Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it first they said at 9 30 they will start then said 10 30 it will start We four were only on the dance floor we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song He didnt oblige at all Would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills God knows Food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar Hope they improve their hospitality That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again Food 3 5 Service 3 5 Overall experience 4 5 Because of friends VFM 3 5 5,3.0,1

Driven Cafe,I love this place Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me Spacious evergreen english songs eg Nirvana Bryan Adams on the back ground It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit talk sip coffee enjoy the background songs not a noisy cafe like some other cafes This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city But the negative point is that they don t have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items ,3.0,1

Frio Bistro,Had a family lunch while on a visit to Hyderabad Suggested by my son settled for the meal We went with the suggestion of the Steward for starters had Mushroom on khari turned out to be a good choice Son wanted to have lamb doner kebab in pita pocket He was okay Spicy tomato arabitta turned out to be a tasteless flavour less offering When we informed the Steward he got a fresh one made personally supervising Turned out to be too saucy no traces of parmesan cheese probably it could have had few more pieces of the penne Finally the meal was concluded with a tiramisu A bigger disappointment ,3.0,1
The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Been to this place along with friends for a small party We loved the place but only concern was service associates were rude Helpless When we complained for burned naan was served then the server stated that we serve Naan likes this only He didnot even apologised very pathetic experience we had ,3.0,1

Khaan Saab,Dishes Tried Lal Mirch Tikka Tundey Kebab Rajwada Ghost The food is okay not great doesn t really live up to the hype Tundey kebab was good but a little bit on spicy side Rajwada Ghost was awesome goodespecially the Kabsa Laham Its a must have for everyone Grilled chicken was a let down though The staff wasn t very welcoming when we mentioned we will using DineOut for payments and you could sense their attitude change The ambience is pretty standard and looks empty ,3.0,1
Shanghai Chef 2,Thier platters might sound a bit confusing since they are more like normal starters but definitely taste good A must try item on their menu is bamboo rice It has tiny bamboo shoots with lemon grass and fresh flavours I absolutely loved it Do not try the 8 treasure hot pot which is listed as a must try on their menu I did not find anything very special in it Its curry was just the same as that of paneer chilli and I was expecting a little moderations there ,3.0,1
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Been to this place on a weekend surprisingly the place was empty but started to fill in soon ordered prawns and paneer tikka they tasted good also ordered corn didn t taste that great coming to movcktails I ve ordered aaamsutra didn t feel like there was alcohol in it the fruit punch was pretty good though the music was too loud coz of which we couldn t have proper conversation a decent place to chill n dance ,3.0,1
Dine O China,American choupsey gravy was a bit sweet then it has to be,3.0,1
Frio Bistro,Frio is set in a dark toned theme with black walls and complementing prismic mirrors with dim lighting to set mood for a quiet interesting evening conversation The music is contemporary and thankfully not too loud It moulds into the environment without intruding into your private space Service was fine We had to keep a lookout for waiters rather than them looking out for us but were courteous and friendly Here is what we ordered 100 arabica cold coffee basic and just right Creamy and not too sugary Dark chocolate shake absolute yum and sinful It tastes exactly as you would want it to The only ask since it s categorized as thickshake it should be thicker but I guess that s the case with shakes served anywhere in the city Chicken ala plancha Sheer dissapointment especially given that it was in chef s special menu It was as ordinary as ordinary can be We ordered scallion rice on the side as the dish is incomplete without carbs It s basically a tomato gravy with chicken and hardly any seasoning Wouldn t recommend Lamb ravioli It s a shame we don t get ravioli in most of the outlets across the city serving pasta Even if they do it s mostly vegetarian spinach and ricotta cheese without exception To our delight Frio doesn t disappoint here The ravioli is good doesn t make it to my top 5 list but still good Ravioli was cooked well herbed garlic bread on side was great and so was the tomato gravy We couldn t get to dessert as we ordered our food during the final order 20 mins before closing but I have heard that their tiramisu is great All in all Frio is a good place to visit In terms of food you could love or let s say not love the place basis what dish you ordered I won t be a frequent here but wouldn t mind going back for another try either Happy dining ,3.0,1
Barbeque Nation,I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past The only thing they handled well from the word go was the seating I booked a table for 14 from zomato It was ready for us when we arrived Everything else seemed to be falling apart their team was struggling to deliver The starters took forever to be served Most of them tasted similar though were called different things refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this some were duly replaced The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes When we held our ground he went back to personally create some dishes His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together ,3.0,1
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Over sausage in the shawrma roll,3.0,1
Frio Bistro,I really had high expectations for Frio Bistro It d been on my To Eat list for a while The food is average We had a pasta the Chicken Sausage paella and a cheesecake Nothing was really sooo yummy out of the world And it was really costly But the staff was courteous However I probably won t come here again,3.0,1
Arena Eleven,Experience at Arena Eleven Since it s in SLN Terminus mall it s not very difficult to find It was a Friday when we had dinner here and the experience it wasn t the best although it could be Place was packed by 9 9 30 pm Definitely this place has the potential to improve and become better One big minus point is that on a Friday evening the washroom was out of order and I had to cross all SLN third floor to get to the toilet Ups that s really bad Ambiance is vibrant atmosphere is good but the music is too loud Usually I don t mind the music but here was really difficult to have a conversation They have screens and it s a good place to watch some sports There is some kind of terrace too and that s good till the hot summer Service was good regarding the waiters but really slow in bringing the food out from the kitchen They also have to change their menus or something because many items we tried to order weren t available like burgers pizza etc On a Friday evening pizza and burgers definitely will be ordered When it comes to the food we had enjoyed thoroughly some items but others were just average We had sizzling kebab platter Chipotle and jamaican chicken and lemon and pepper fish we choose Awesome kebabs Really juicy and tasty every each one of them We had sizzling mint biryani which also was delicious They didn t give any mirch ka salaan raitha or onion with the biryani just plain but I asked for some raitha and they brought Rice was flavoured and chicken was tender but just 4 small pieces The let down were the rolls We had 4 different types of rolls with fries and wedges Maximum average on quality and taste The price is on the expensive side but it still worth a try at least for the kebabs Food 3 5 5 Ambiance 3 5 Service 3 5 5 Value 3 5,3.0,1
Chinese Pavilion,I had ordered Manchow Soup The taste was very nice It felt like a great start Crispy noodles in it added a great texture and taste to the Soup chicken was cooked well overall a very good subtle starter The Chilli Chicken Dry was One of the best I ve tasted was kinda smoky chicken was cooked very well the prawns quality and taste were justtt totally ammazing cooked to perfection Only drawback was the price and quantity werent up to the mark the Chilli Garlic Burnt Sauce tasted extremely weird The chicken fried rice was not that great too It had good aroma and aura but taste was average The restaurant had good ambience Overall it was good experience,3.0,1
Al Saba Restaurant,This was ok but not tasty I have ordered chicken Biryani here it was ok we can taste it once or twice because some one like some thing it looks good,3.0,1

Pakwaan Grand,Food is good but paking is worst,3.0,1
Driven Cafe,After a lot of reco s and solid rating everywhere I finally tried out Driven Cafe mainly to sample their coffee Unfortunately I was disappointing with the Cappuccino Tried a medium Cappuccino which is a double expresso shot coffee with foamed milk and it was very underwhelming No aroma no kick it was very bland and generic Had a hard time getting through it The wife tried Frappe which was as per her taste and my daughter who has a major sweet tooth found her choco chip brownie nice However I was quite disappointed overall ,3.0,1
Desi Bytes,This open air restaurant situated right at the mouth of the Whitefield turning has branded itself as a Chinese and North Indian restaurant but the Chinese on offer was not good at all The soup we ordered had a weird taste and we did not dare to venture further into the chinese menu the restaurant had to offer The Litti chokha on the other hand was pretty good And they even claim to serve the best litti chokha in town Can t say whether it s the best or not but they did get it right ,3.0,1
The Chocolate Room,Sinful Nothing describes this place better Going through their super extensive menu would probably make you tired but the service is so appalling probably you ll die of hunger waiting for your order to arrive The place is cosy enough for you to carry a laptop and spend a couple hours on an assignment I d recommend you do that cause anyway they deliver orders after forever As the name goes I ve always had it in my mind to relate this place to a dessert bar And hence I ve never tried the savoury items offered here But I ve heard they have a good offering among sandwiches and nachos So that would keep my review limited only to the sweet dishes The Toblerone Shake and the Kitkat Shake are the shizzz So full of the taste actually well prepared The chocolate brownie is really a waste of money you ve probably had much better brownies all over Hyderabad Nutella Waffles and Death by Chocolate pancakes so good A heaven full of chocolate sauce and ice cream Make sure to hit the gym soon after P Slightly higher on the price point but worth a try ,3.0,1
Cafe Eclat,It s a little expensive place I feel coffee was normal nothing great about it But blueberry cheese cake was different and good If u visit the place then their cheese cake is a must try ,3.0,1

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,I ordered French toast but didnt taste like french toast Chef team can work on this for a better output There are very few places where french toast is available if the taste is improved this place can lead ,3.0,1
Mathura Vilas,We visited this place many times Not so crowded Good ambience Their thalis are good and a value for money Their ala carte items are not so good in taste and not worth the price esp platters and other starters Their service is very slow and you need to be patient I would rate this restaurant 3 5,3.0,1
Cafe Eclat,The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool But we were in for huge disappointments They have too vast a menu for them to handle Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago We ordered their self recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken This at a cost of Rs 280 was completely unreasonable for me The chicken and mushroom soup was good but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago Coffee was ok pretty much standard as everywhere else All in all hugely disappointed with the promises of FRESH and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing ,3.0,1
Pakwaan Grand,Ordered mutton Biriyani and Kebab from this restaurant Biriyani was good but kebab was average Hope they improve the quality of Kebab Menu is pretty rich and price is also fair ,3.0,1
The Indi Grill,This restro is located in Gachibowli in The Platina building We headed to this place for dinner with team on Friday evening The place is good ambience wise and the stuff are friendly too The service was quick and they do ask you the reviews and suggestions Now coming to the food it was okay but as compared to other buffet kitchens like ABs or Barbeque Nation they still lag behind with the same price The starters were good in taste but the main course and dessert was ok ok ,3.0,1
Eat India Company,Happened to visit this place for dinner on last Sunday The ambience is amazing with decor pieces from Rajasthan They have used various elements in a smart way We opted for a dinner buffet The variety of items in the buffet were good But starters were served cold on the table This place is decently priced I personally loved the Thai soup chicken kabab butter naan and dal Food 3 5 5 Ambience 4 5 Service 4 5,3.0,1

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,The name is so appealing that when we saw it we were like yes let s go Because all of us just looovee the movie But also because it s on a busy roadside Very convenient location It was Wednesday and had a ladies night I think But as you know gold can t be availed with ladies night privileges We got seating very easily Don t know of that was a good thing or bad because the place was very empty Only 2 other tables were seated I think Ambience is okay music can be better Cocktails were good You can actually tell them to do some tweaks to your drinks as per your likeness and they would do it Service can be better was slow when you look there were very less crowd Food is very nice Pocket friendly place Hope next time I get to see a good crowd and good music,3.0,1

Mustang Terrace Lounge,The place I have visited many times made me sad by the last visit Because most of the tables they kept on reserved though during staying there till 10 30pm we have not seen anyone to come and occupy the seats The starters items are extremely costly and very less in quantity Only reason of visiting the place is roof top Otherwise it is one of the most expensive places to visit in Gachibowli area ,3.0,1

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,I was pretty excited looking at the 4 6 rating But quite disappointed I would rate the food at 4 though But service is extremely poor The staff isn t good at recommending dishes The Beef curry with Naga chilli isn t good probably because they had overused some condiment giving it a bitter taste The pork belly was good Beef fry wasn t great because meat was undercooked The steam country chicken curry was good I would give this restaurant another chance and come back again because I really love the food from the north east and then order something which would be actually good and worth the rating it boasts right now ,3.0,1

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Hard to get hold of their attention After a number of visits I now have come to terms that it usually takes 10 15 mins for them to come tend to you Heck even a glass of water takes time to come to the table Service needs to get better Anyways coming to the food a great place for most things pork My favorite dish which is something I totally gorge over is the Bosam Nicely sliced pieces of pork belly kimchi and tender pices of chillies Each bite is a bliss The kimchi pork fried rice is good too though I wish they could improve upon the quantity of pork in the dish ,3.0,1

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Filtered entry Check Welcome assistance Check Crowd Check Ambience Check What s great Nothing It s a good sports bar with zero sense of consumer experience when it comes to to service and value for money Half the order doesn t come on time you ll have to repeatedly pesture your waiter who just keeps running half the time The fancy sports bar is not adequately staffed and even though they filter the crowd by putting a stag entry fee which is covered too many people are stiffed inside and I don t think they have the ability to serve the kind of crowd they attract Overall I liked the food and the place but it was a disappointment that night We left to a more peaceful place for the rest of night The cocktails are good though ,3.0,1

Beyond Flavours,I have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences 1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly Their special baked biriyani is work a try it s unique and tasty Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister She orders a mocktail and it was terrible they replace it but it was still not good And then I asked them about a starter if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both It s disappointing to know that the staff doesn t know about the menu ,3.0,1

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sardarji s chaats and more is synonymous with the typical street food in Delhi and is nostalgia served in a plate all over for people who have for any point of time savored on the street food in delhi The sandwiches especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome The dahi bhalla dahi papdi s are good too However off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food Another complaint i had with them are their parathas they are bad polar opposite to their chaat dishes I would never recommend anyone ordering paratha s from this place and I tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked This is the reason I have rated them as 3 out 5 ,3.0,1

PourHouse7,Went to Pour House 7 in Gachibowli recently The rooftop seating is very airy We ordered Virgin Mojito tasted ok Orange chat pat Tasted yummy Chicken Manchow soup tasted ok Hyderabadi Tawa Fish this one was a crowd pleaser but unfortunately couldn t please me Lahsuni Paneer Tikka paneer tikka was good flavors were well balanced Tangdi Kebab it was ok Tandoori Brocolli this one was impressive I liked the lemon marmalade that they served with it For main course we orderd Butter Naan it was way too thin and oily Murg Cashew Nut Tasted good For dessert we had Brownie the sides were too crispy Could have tasted better Overall I think there s room for a lot of improvement in their food and ambience The music can also be better Hope they will take it as constructive feedback and work at it ,3.0,1
Tiki Shack,Not that much great place reason being the service is very slow No one comes to take the order Located in a great business area with all the big companies The place has energy and good vibe but service is something that needs to be worked on They have started serving different vapes at this place which costs around 700 800 Thats something cool you get in different flavours Food is fine Cheers Rakshita Nath,3.0,1

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,I came here for a buffet The overall experience was average They have a huge spread to choose from only in the salads and when it comes down to starters and main course i was pretty disappointed because of pretty limited options i had to choose from even from which there was just a single starter that made me even think about seconds The deserts were decent i loved the chocolate ice cream Moving on to ambience the seating and the restaurant was pretty decent and i think the true look and feel could be experienced at its best if you were to visit the place for a dinner The service was pretty swift Food 2 5 Ambience 4 5 Overall 3 5,3.0,1

Mathura Vilas,Disappointed with their so called special Navaratri thali festival they did not have any other option of thali during this time and when asked about north indian or south indian thali they told that they have only special Navaratri thali we decided to order two of them Nothing special in this one by Navaratri thali you would expect kadhi khichadi and some good options but this was actually a mix of north and south indian thali utappam sambar payasam kela sabji mixture from South and tandoor roti puri corn n peas sabji tikki from north and small mixed fruits salad green chutney sweet chutney plain curd they had just plain steam rice They missed serving us welcome drink of chaas lassi Overall disappointed for the price paid and options received ,3.0,1

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area we have other choices Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there 1 Crabmeat Soup This soup was thick with minced crab meat The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce vineager and crushed pepper The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds 2 Corn Cubes A must try out platter The dish was innovative The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency 3 Chicken Yakitori I did not like this preparation It was very dull and tasteless There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor Main Course 1 Manchow Chicken Fried Rice The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own Dessert 1 Bangkok Custurd I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts It tasted like Firni As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls It was just yum for the greedy tongue Total Rs 1396 Inclusive of taxes Cobclusion The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card No coordination among the staffs Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions Its just okayish for casual dinner lunch I will think twice to visit this place again ,3.0,1

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Sheraton is one of the best hotels in Hyderabad but their restaurant fails to match the expectations I have come here twice for the Buffet and the only good thing was some desserts They have very few options in Vegetarian starters Pizza is not of the best quality whole pasta is good Their desserts looks mind blowing but only few of them are actually very good Ambiance is pretty amazing but it s not the worth the price you pay for the kind of food you get here ,3.0,1
Hunger Maggi Point,I used to spot this shop opposite to the DLF IT park while coming back from work during my stay in Hyderabad Always crowded with majority of the IT people nearby and all other food delivery agents waiting to take parcel Got to know that they are also delivering till the wee hours of the night I was wanting to order from here once for that taste of Maggi Who doesn t like a fancy maggi noodles So one fine night ordered for a Corn Masala Cheese Butter Maggi through Zomato That was the most fanciest name I could find on their menu The delivery was smooth and the packing was okayish in a plastic box along with a plastic spoon and fork The maggi was somewhat soggy and some what semi gravyish which I am not that big a fan of It could have been a bit drier But the taste was really good and one could feel all the butter cheese in the maggi Good cost effective outlet for the love of Maggi Noodles ,3.0,1

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Arabian touch to a sumptuous feast A great place for team outings and the Mandis will make your team work totally worth it Good taste in food and great ambience Service could be improved a notch The Mandis will fill up to 3 people and is worth the penny Courteous staff and great seating arrangement Best visited in the night P S Don t get flabbergasted by the looks of the Mandi Personal favourites Chicken BBQ Mandi Mutton Juicy Mandi Fairly good shawarmas sp chicken cheese shawarma ,3.0,1
Kritunga Restaurant,I had ordered food from Kritunga many times to my office and had visited this place once Gachibowli The ambience here is good and the staff was attentive The steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry it was very delicious I also tried gongura chicken it was fine Apart from these I tried spl chicken biryani kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery Overall i would say the food here is good a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies Packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order it would great if the food could be packed in boxes ,3.0,1
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Went for lunch with friends ala carte Liked the ambience though it was really far to get to We had the Caesar salad which was fresh and could have used a bit more seasoning Pizza arabiata really nice crust thin and ingredients fresh and tasty Penne pasta chicken was also good though the chicken seemed dry The best dish was Thai green curry vegetables which was served with a jasmine rice the best ever flavours a must try Now coming to the desserts we had the philadelphia cheese cake baked nice plating but cheesecake can be improved significantly Creme brule was good loved the crispy carmelized sugar crust There was a lot of crowd and it took us a long time to get our orders Overall it was a nice experience hope to have a better one next time ,3.0,1
SKYHY,been here couple of times on weekdays it has both open area and closed area too the ambience was nice the quality of food is ok ok DJ was good The service was fine but you are not valued if you are going as a stag After spending some time felt its too cold outside so asked if I can go to closed area but they refused even after requesting which made me to leave the place earlier Food 4 5 Ambience 4 5 5 Music 4 5 5 Service 3 5,3.0,1

Ulavacharu,Been to this place with my friends today Let me start with the good part first ordered Bamboo chicken as part of starter which tasted awesome but the quantity is little compared to the price they charge As part of main course we ordered Rayala vari kodi pulao which tasted good but again the quantity is very less compared to the pricing and also the portion of chicken served is little in quantity next comes the dish which was hyped Raju gari kodi pulao they took almost 25 mins to get it served on the table we were waiting on the table after finishing the starters and first part of main course for this dish to be served we were kind of disappointed as the dish did not taste good In short good place but pricing is bit high value for money 3 out of 5 Bamboo chicken tasted good but pricing INR 435 is high for the quantity we get ,3.0,1
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,I read a lot of reviews about this place before visiting most of them read that the service is very slow I only realised it after I went there I was so tired waiting for my food that I only had starters here and went to some other place for dinner Food was no wonder very tasty We ordered drums of heaven and pork belly in chilly sauce It all tasted really nice I hope the place works on their service ,3.0,1
Absolute Sizzlers,When we first tried that was 8months back the food taste and the quantity was good Now they seems very much focused on offers not the quantity and quality of food Very disappointed on my next two visits They started reducing the quantity of the main dish in their Sizzlers seems now the main dish is just for topping to attract ,3.0,1

eat.fit,For the first time tried the light lunch meal from Eat fit which has 450Kcal as mentioned Decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box Chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil Chapatis were homely soft and warm something a bit hard to get in Hyderabad A less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier Not sure if I would order this again but could maybe try their salads ,3.0,1

The Tilt Bar Republic,Just make sure why you are going there If food it would be a 3 rating yes comparatively cheaper buffet in near by restaurants though and if it drinks it would hang near 4 Their varieties in drinks get that for them Place is good in ambiance but total inside so not a roof top or garden You can enjoy the game days well than other days And yes a good value for your money,3.0,1

The Fisherman's Wharf, 6packfoodie goes The Fisherman s Wharf Food 5 5 why 3 5 in the main review then Ambience 5 5 Courtesy and staff 1 5 Zomato gold experience 1 5 When we reserve table we expect to get the seat preference I booked the table for 2 with seat preference as Outdoor seating The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you ve booked indoor seating when i did show the details about my booking then she said Outdoor seating cannot be reserved If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page Disappointed Finally after the discussion we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking Moving on lets go to food Ambience The entire olace has goan vibe to it The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa Drinks LIIT one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad The lime mint juice was also tasty Food Ordered beef chilly fry The tenderness of the meat was perfect Spice level presentation was worth the price They have as per size menu for their specialities such as lobsters prawns Pomfret We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns Again the presentation and the taste was class apart The spice balance was fantastic Now comes the worst zomato gold experience Before ordering as you woukd expect i unlocked my zomato gold which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary beef chilly fry in my case since it was lower priced among the two The guy who served us didn t come with the bill Another guy came up saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary because as per size menu is not included in the zomato gold Which means you have to pay for everything This was never mentioned anywhere neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere We had to pay for the entire bill irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff Later ordered one more dish as a take away which was made complementary If potion size and value for money is what you re looking for then this olace is not for you If you re a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad then thumbs up Peace ,3.0,1
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Having heard a lot about this place and my curiosity to try a new cuisine that s a part of India but different from the other usual cuisines led me and a bunch of my friends to Zing s for dinner First up we were greeted with a distinct smell of raw pork which was mildly unpleasant The starters were quite good spicy chicken momos and the pork preparations pork belly and some kind of chilly fried pork The main course however was disappointing or perhaps we expected something else The Ramyum noodles tasted like a bland version of Top Ramen and the noodles had a strange texture to them There was not enough broth either which you tend to expect from any kind of ramen noodles The Teriyaki chicken rice was a tad too sweet for my palette personally The best thing would be the prices everything is so resonably priced it s not easy to find non veg especially pork beef etc at these prices One major area of feedback would be the service They have an extremely laidback dont really care attitude and it took a bit of effort for us to get their attention and get them to the table each time A little more effort from the management and they could be do loads better than they are currently maybe even start a franchise Value for money 3 5 5 Service 2 5 Ambience 3 5 Overall 3 5,3.0,1
Driven Cafe,Explored this place today and was surprisingly very good because it never occurred me to try out for this long Has an American cafe ambiance and feel and is open until 1 AM at least The cheese garlic bread veg puffs and Latte coffee were pretty good It s self service and the order came in pretty quick One and only suggestion is that maybe they can focus a little more on cleanliness Overall a good place for a quick catch up with friends over a bite Amit Agrawal Harsh Jhunjhunwala Poorvi Agarwal,3.0,1

Olive Garden,It was my 4th order with Olive Garden in the last 6 months I loved the food from this place and this is the reason I ended up ordering from here multiple times This time it was a total disappointment in terms of the Veg Food and the service that was provided There was no difference in terms of taste and appearance for Veg Dum Biryani Veg Pulao Both of these dishes were same I don t know how the restaurant makes that difference still wondering In terms of the service I ordered the food from Zomato at 8 00PM and the time of delivery was shown as 8 55PM I ordered it keeping in mind my meeting timing however the restaurant was able to provide food to the delivery guy only at 9 30 which is like 35 mins late from the slated time I would still want to rate the food a 4 even after my bad exp with Biryani Pualo Service wise I would rate this place a 2 5 The manager executive from the restaurant to whom I spoke over the phone just kept saying one thing that sir we are working on your order and it will take 10 mins ,3.0,1
Hyper Local,The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too The ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up The utilisation of the limited space is done well A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set Moving on to the food we tried the newly launched Drudge menu Priced at Rs 1200 this was an expensive affair However if you are early I e before 4 30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for 799 They had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food The drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler The buffet Consisted of golgappe Dahi bhalle Sev puri bruschetta mini veg and non veg pizza Dahi kachori chole bhature red Thai curry with rice chicken tikka fries noodles and chicken tikka pockets Golgappe Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste Dahi kachori was a complete let down The bruschetta stood out and pizza was average Chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren t crisp The red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation Noodles were randomly kept with no gravy The chicken tikka pockets were dry The chicken tikka was good and marinated very well Overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn t go together The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn t sound correct The music was extremely loud for the place Overall we had a below average Experience Based on the drunch menu I would rate it 2 5 5,3.0,1

SKYHY,I had been to this place last weekend with family I must say the service is excellent Coming to the ambience the dance floor and the area beside that looks great but the rooftop wasn t that interesting 1 less star only for that But other than that the food was good but not that great We ordered 1 Budweiser 3 2 Virgin Mojito 2 It was soooooo good 3 Chicken Tikka Could have cooked more 4 Crispy chicken Asian Style 5 Dragon Chicken 6 Chicken pulao Same as Biryani nothing great Overall I feel a little more work to be put into deco on the rooftop a little on food But a good open air experience Best if you come as a couple The dance floor will be open to you ,3.0,1

Hyper Local,Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200 per person The place itself is located in a good open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer My experience with their food was decent The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle Dahi Vade Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe Speaking about their main course they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature Veg Hakka Noodles Red thai curry Chicken pizza Steamed Rice Chicken tikka Chicken wings and Chicken pockets Looking at the price of the drunch I feel a bit more items should have been on offer Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious However they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout The best part about the place was the drinks section Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail Sangria and Cranberry Cooler Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place All in all the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes Happy eating ,3.0,1

Mustang Terrace Lounge,With an impressive location it could have been one of the prime spots but the placement of items seems unimaginative The ambiance created with the light bulbs is utterly ruined with a large screen in the middle of the room The sound system needs improvement with focus on more than just base The food is good and it was worth the wait in this decrepit atmosphere The outdoor seats are not as comfortable and there is no measure to tackle scenarios of rain It is a decent place to just have food but expect nothing more,3.0,1
Mathura Vilas,Ordered malai kofta very sweet n has a peculiar after taste the butter naan was chewy only the tandoori roti was good the only think i liked ,3.0,1
Eat India Company,This place has a good ambiance and is a treat for people wanting to take pictures but that s about it Went on a Sunday and there was no crowd at all The AC was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside The service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming Starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good the pace of refills needed to improve I honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course The stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that s about it It s expensive factoring in the food and service you get These guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment Could give it a try for the ambiance though ,3.0,1

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Cascade is a spacious coffeeshop with an extensive menu We tried the lamb burger club sandwich and spaghetti in tomato sauce Food was fine although the chef forgot to add bacon in club sandwich Spaghetti was yum There was slight delay in service although staff came and apologised later There were good breads available for sale although noone really encouraged you to buy Staff lacks initiative ,3.0,1

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Reservation was confirmed on the phone multiple times as I was hosting a group of 20 people but we didn t have a table when we reached I was told that I spoke to one employee but the other employee didn t know so its not his responsibility I however contacted the hotel so not sure how I am supposed to inform ALL employees for a simple reservation It was quite an inconvenience because the whole group was made to stand for 15 mins and wait and move tables as well The staff was not apologetic either so we were quite disappointed This was a corporate booking with colleagues so we would not have expected this to happen,3.0,1
NorFest - The Dhaba,Last time I ordered mutton rogan josh from here it was amazing but today it was not fresh and only bones no meat It s sad my favourite restaurant is going down in quality,3.0,1
T Grill,On the way back home from Mrugavani National Park had a stop here for lunch I really felt the present state of this place like lot of things gone missing First impression no one at the parking to guide or coordinate it all were parked zigzag welcomed by foul odour at that point Huge place but no one seem to let us know of how to proceed further like where to sit or dine especially if it was first time like me Initially noticed an outdoor seating organized perfectly under hut shape units spread across the whole area with vibrant chairs and tables Felt like scorching sun breeze wouldn t make us withstand it for quite long and so thought not an good idea to have lunch outdoors also felt kitchen exhaust smoke widespread No one cared to guide until I personally asked of any indoor is available So shifted to inside dining room great relief finding at a corner a place for us Our order was Veg platter not worth price taste quantity Jumbo chicken Biryani evenly cooked tender chicken not so flavorful Mutton Biryani is good Service lag may be of huge rush Missing fine dine features asked for finger bowl but got an answer to wash hands outside Village back drop artifact greenery are little bit saviors May be at evening hours outdoor seating could be good choice Anyway no thrill at T grill ,3.0,1
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,This was one of those places on my list that I have been wanting to try for the longest time that I can remember I specifically wanted to try out the Sushi Veg in this place I remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for Japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available In any case I ordered a stater shanghai rolls which was average and finally went ahead and ordered Sushi for myself wife and a pizza for my daughter The sushi was good but not as good as the one I had tried at Mamagoto my fav place for asian cuisine The pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic Italian restaurants in the city I also tried their creme brulee best of the lot which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping In my opinion they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself I would have rated it 3 5 but for their really slow service and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings All in all an average place to try out I might go back to try some of their other items on the menu Ambiance 3 5 Food 3 5 5 Service 2 5 5,3.0,1

KS Bakers,A new place that slowly turned out into a hangout eatery for people with shallow pockets The lighting ambience is warm I love eating the chicken roll that hardly costs 35 bucks A burger costs only 70 Lot of University students depend on KS for a cheap dinner delivery You get free chips with everything you order But personally I felt the cheese they use is a bit weird about sweet for the taste of a traditional Pizza hut afficianado ,3.0,1
Gal Punjab Di,It s a small place so gets crowded easily and noisy easily Although the interior is interesting don t expect much of an ambiance Service was prompt and their happy faces was refreshing after a long day We just tried limited items and they were decent Good to visit for a quick non nonsense dinner ,3.0,1
Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,An evening in THE Radisson itself is one it s kind And when the food is unlimited it s just bliss a heaven on earth We had booked a table via Nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality variety of dishes and a great ambience But somehow we don t know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it It is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that we don t know When I retrospect back home I thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there Not that they were rude but they didn t care much The manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us Well coming to the dishes we had a nice sumptuous dinner The best part was the dessert section If had a variety of spreads It was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes Oh boy I had a ball Had the staff had been a little attentive I d have rated an easy 4 0 I guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the Nearbuy But we ve been too many 5 star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently Taste 3 5 Ambience 3 5 Staff 2 5 Value for money 3 5,3.0,1
Barbeque Nation,To start with the complimentary drinks Blue mojito pacific blue fresh lime soda were refreshing The nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken prawns or fish Head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day The veg starters Mushroom is a immediate No cripsy corn was not salted properly paneer came as a saviour Maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer Coming to Desserts Its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled Browine was too dry cakes were not tasty apple pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup phirni an absolute no kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it Overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section I can only rate it 3 for food 5 for service 3 for ambience as its too crowded going neck to neck in every counter ,3.0,1

Deli 9 Bistro,More is not always merrier hot dog with lettuce and tomatoes was tasting more like a sub sandwich although after removing the veggies it tasted really nice Home style potato wedges were a good attempt but a little too bland Penne pasta was overcooked but the sauce had not soaked in all flavours hence tasted a undercooked Best part was the desert old fashioned pastry which was not too sweet and not too chocolate Overall experience was goodsince the staff is very considerate and ambience is very comforting,3.0,1
Pot Pourri,We visited this restaurant recently We have ordered Potpourri Royyala Vepudu Gongura Mamsam not there in the menu they have made it on our request and plain rice Potpourri Royyala Vepudu A south Indian style prawn medium sized starter dry This dish had at least 15 20 prawns The prawns were coated and cooked in spices The prawns were little chewy in texture but was very tasty Gongura Mamsam Small pieces of mutton cooked in a gongura based gravy We found this dish too sour I guess they have added tamarind too compared to our previous experience with Gongura based gravy Overall experience was nice The service was good ,3.0,1
Over The Moon Brew Company,The place and ambience was good Only sour point was our waiter Kundan who told us to change places as soon as we were seated maybe to accommodate his regular guests who tip him well I had Zomato gold membership and showed him the same Instead of taking a photo of the same he started surfing the phone When I objected he denied checking the phone Though the food and place was good the waiter spoiled the mood just with his creepy attitude which cost the two stars ,3.0,1

The Tilt Bar Republic,I would rate ambience hardly at three and doesn t look like the pics on Zomato The place was smelly and even the AC wasn t working well Beers with fancy names and glasses was an attraction but that was the only point of attraction and the taste was a big let down They don t have an in house brewery but beers are imported as they claim and very costly too In comparison to it there are a lot of places to try in house brewed beers like OTM brewery etc Even their food menu is so limited and we tried their chicken pizza and it was one of the worst tasting pizza I had in a long time just chicken pieces and no other topping at all at 450 Bucks Similar experience with fish and chips the batter was running away from the fish and it was over fried and was more or less feels like eating chips then fish Really a disappointing experience and more disappointing as I went with high hopes I don t recommend this to anyone because it s not even cheap to recommend to those who don t want to spend much ,3.0,1

Green Bawarchi Restaurant,average,3.0,1
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,This restaurant has its priorities straight Unlike AB s Flechazo and Barbeque Nation that swing for the fences and end up failing many times this place has hit a sweet balance between Hospitality and Taste Which means you have none of the irritating fake friendly over eager monkeys from the above mentioned places pushing and prodding you to try weird stuff even if you don t want to Instead you get a homely little corner where you can sit quietly and be left alone to mind your business until you order for something Very professional indeed The starters are awesome here they actually set the tone for the things to come This place features a wide range of delectable options for vegetarian diners as well which is a big step up from its competitors Kebabs are to die for Having said that the main meal was nothing to write home about They have tried a lot of things from Mughlai Intercontinental to Chinese but somehow these dishes don t come together on the plate But what actually took my heart away what this joint EXCELS in hands down compared to ANY FREAKING RESTAURANT IN THE CITY is the Desserts department For someone who loves sweets it s a psychedelic experience The variety and taste will haunt you for days The desserts are neither too sweet nor too rich Just the type that the northern crowd will go berserk about I was thoroughly satisfied and if you leave out the clove heavy gravy of mutton and the generic dishes of the main menu then the place is a RockaRolla discovery Definitely worth one visit and then the count will just keep on ticking ,3.0,1

Driven Cafe,Driven is a bike themed cafe where you can even take bikes or luxury cars for rent This is located in the busiest IT areas of Hyderabad This is one of the places that is open till late night in this area Though the food is good here but certainly overpriced Their cold coffee is really good but the brownies need to be a little soft ,3.0,1
AB's - Absolute Barbecues,Visited this place with my friends strong recommendation and great reviews seen To be honest it didn t live up to the great reviews and great reputation it has Food spread is huge and too many varieties are there so a big thumsup for the same Quality of food is not wow but very average prawn barbeque and chicken was very average Service is good and taken good care of Ambience was ok it was feeling hot and we were sweating inside All in all a average ok experience ,3.0,1

GD's,I ve been to this place on my friends suggestion Ordered one single chicken burger I don t remember the name exactly The chicken is grilled to perfection Chicken piece is enormous than burger infact when you bite the burger its not the burger which goes into your mouth its the chicken which goes into your mouth first They ve also stuffed alot of cheese into it Good taste for a street level burger place but there is definitely scope for an improvement ,3.0,1
The Tilt Bar Republic,Landed in this small bar for new year lunch buffet They had limited items in their spread but each of them were super yummy Nothing to complain about as this costed us merely 400bucks per head For drinks I would totally recommend Project 51 cocktail A must try The only downside was service The waiters were friendly but extremely idle and we had a waiting period of atleast 10mins between the serves Many of the items were only served after repeated calls ,3.0,1

Delhi-39,Ordered a lot from this place and went for dine in a lot of times as well The biggest issue with this place is lack of consistency It is okay for the price range but the quality and taste of food will be a surprise almost every time We usually have Mushroom Masala Usually quite good with good amount of mushrooms Garlic Naan Nice and crispy Mixed Raita This has always been good In terms of ambience it has very less to offer and an okayish service ,3.0,1

Faasos,My actual rating is 3 5 I ordered veg wraps few days back Service was quick I must say packaging was really good I ordered veg cheesy melt paneer wrap and paneer Tikka wrap They also served tikha masala with wrap Those who love spicy food must like this masala Cheesy melt paneer wrap was outstanding Cheese was busting in mouth with each bite paneer and gravy was really tasty It has Punjabi flavor with cheese combination Loved it Paneer wrap It was average in taste as the gravy was little bland and plus it has cheakpea curry which annoyed me a lot taste was not good My experience was good Follow me on Instagram on veganyums for more pics and food fun ,3.0,1
NorFest - The Dhaba,They definitely promise you a decent meal Known for their timely delivery and packaging norfest doesn t disappoint you Nonveg starter platter is more than enough for two people Perfectly cooked two pieces of Tangdi kebab malai kebab and angara kebab might not leave a lasting impression but in general they are well marinated and taste good Punjabi Non veg thali is perfectly packed meal box from salad to raita In a non veg thali veg curries definitely need no mention but no one can ignore dal makhani Wake up the dal makhani by stirring it as all the dal sunks to the bottom and sleeps Felt it can be a bit thicker in consistency Butter chicken was so delicious and mild in spicies Butter rotis were hard and tough to tear the usual packaging side effects Boondi raita definitely needs a mention for it s delicious texture and taste and so the rice kheer ,3.0,1

Hyper Local,I and my friend went here to watch the IPL live screening and have some good time One good thing was that they have 2 2 on drinks through Zomato gold The food pretty decent too but what I didn t like was that it didn t have good options in drinks especially non alcoholic We eventually went for Masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad We asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldn t take it back Wasn t happy with the service Also the live music there wasn t great ,3.0,1

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,The DJ who plays at this place is really good We went in a group of 10 people and enjoyed a lot On the downside the food and drinks service is really slow and number of waiters are less as compared to seating strength of the place The people on bar counter suck big time as they don t talk properly give you respect and try to loot you by saying half of the low price drinks are not available ,3.0,1

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,We went for a family dinner on 15th April Being a 5 star restaurant some basic amenities were missing which you can easily get in any local drive in or a dhaba Noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 7 8 min whereas in any other 5 star a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry However we went inside and opted for a buffet The food spread was very good however few of them were cold roast chkn and fish tikka The fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert The most annoying thing was the on the table service The table wasnt ready when we were seated We had to ask for napkin spoon fork and even for a glass of water Multiple times The empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean The taste of the food was good though and thats the only reason for me giving a 3 star ,3.0,1
Ulavacharu,Food and ambiance are great here but cost of the food is high with respect to quantity Service was too slow and can t able to manage things We ordered Raju gari kodi pulao chicken majestic and ulvacharu kodi pulao names are self explanatory and village names which makes the taste buds high to taste Overall review Raju gari kodi pulao is spicy and must taste food if you like some liquidity in pulao ,3.0,1

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,This restaurant space in Gachibowi is the fusion of Urban Asia and Eat India Company which are under the same roof with different names Ambience This is very much spacious having multiple separated halls for group dining with cozy ambience This restaurant is themed with village style vintage wooden decors all around the place Most of the interior walls are covered with vintage wooden doors windows and locks And also there is a separate dining hall where one of the wall is completely covered with photo frames of old nizami Kings and their belongings Food We went here for a dinner buffet The food is really delicious and this was the first time I was liking Sea food in the starters All the starters are really good but Kung Pao fish and Prawns parsely dry are the best of its kind Dinner Buffer Menu Starters 1 Murgh Haryali Tikka 2 Lahsooni Murgh Tikka 3 Kung Pao Fish 4 Prawns Parsely dry 5 Crispy Potato Corn cube 6 Sichuan Baby Corn 7 Paneer Angar Tikka 8 Corn Tikka 9 French fries Main Course 1 Bindi Jai Puri 2 Yellow Dal Tadka 3 Palak Paneer 4 Murgh Lababdar 5 Mutton do Pyaza 6 Murgh Dum biryani 7 Sabzi Dum biryani 8 Garlic noodles 9 Butter Naan and Roti 10 Curd Rice 11 Khow suey Salads 1 Tossed Salad 2 Crispy Noodles Salad 3 Kimchi Salad 4 Grilled chicken salad Desserts 1 Pineapple Tarts 2 Chocolate Brownie 3 Pastries 4 Shahi Tukda 5 Varied flavors of ice creams We don t have much variety in desserts but the ice creams here are really good and served with different luscious toppings Just looking at them will trigger the cravings in your mouth Service The only saddest part of this restaurant is the service that they provide Though it is a buffet All the starters will served to the table There is a lot much interval from one starter to the other starter that they serve And you will feel that half the time your plate is empty and you need to keep on waiting for them to serve The service part of this restaurant is really irritating and this needs to be corrected with much importance Value for money The dinner buffet here costs around Rs 650 per person And you will definitely feel that this place is worth your money Be prepared to bear with the bad service and rest you will definitely enjoy Have a great dining and good day ,3.0,1

Cafe Eclat,Went there on a Sunday evening with the intention of having just a coffee and relax as you do in a cafe This review is not going to be about the food taste and quality and ambiance which is good as reviewed by numerous others but a different thing which bothered me once I started going through the menu how expensive the place is I have been to swanky places in 5 star hotels but they are expensive because they are IN 5 star hotels This place is at an ordinary location with very ordinary ambiance Could never figure why my coffee was 300 bucks and the cheese cake slice 400 Taste 4 stars Value For Money 2 star Overall 3 stars,3.0,1

Diners Pavilion,My second visit to this place Visited this restaurant once back in 2016 and was thoroughly disappointed This visit was better than the last one Was here for a team lunch with my colleagues we opted for the buffet The ambience of this place is decent There were some minor issues such as the table we sat on was uneven there was no salt and pepper on the table also there were no condiments Upon requesting the waiter served us Ketchup and Green chutney As we sat the waiters started serving the starters They included hara bhara kabab aloo tikki garlic paneer tandoori pineapple crispy corn and Chilly eggs Tandoori pineapple was a little different and in a good way relief from the barbecued pineapple dish that we often have at other restaurants Crispy corn hara bhara kabab and the tikki were also good The egg dish was average and garlic paneer was below average Veg Tom Yum soup was decent The main course was a bit disappointing Paneer Butter Masala tasted very bad and the rice dish with the tag name Kashmiri Pulao wasn t actually Kashmiri Pulao The two other Veg curries tasted average The desserts consisted only Vanilla ice cream Gulab Jamun and Moong dal halwa This was probably the most distasteful Moong dal halwa I ve ever eaten The service was prompt But this place didn t give me any reason to why I should visit again at least for a buffet The only way they re different is that they offer complimentary unlimited soft drinks But I think that is not good enough to keep customers coming back I ve visited places less than 1Km from this place who charge the same amount and yet have more variety of food If they can t increase the varieties they should start serving different new food compared to others because I m not visiting again if I can have similar food and better somewhere else Ambience 3 Service 3 5 Taste 3 Value for money 3 Overall 3 P S Apologies for the bad pictures,3.0,1
Frio Bistro,The place has a nice quiet ambience I was surprised that it wasn t crowded as you d expect a top place to be on a weekend We were ushered in well and we choose a nice cozy place the place had a nice charm to it We ordered the Tangy Grilled Mushrooms and the Glazed Pork Ribs but the disappointing aspect of our visit though was we were rushed into placing the order We came in at 10pm and we were told to place our last orders instantly when I checked they said the place shuts down at 11pm and the last order was at 10 15pm Coming to food the mushrooms seemed a bit too tangy but that s probably my palate the glazed pork ribs were top notch and juicy and tender Had it not been for the pushy waiters we would have liked to order drinks and a dessert too The waiters made sure that they cleared the plates in a jiffy and pounced on us with our last spoon handing us the copy of the bill and all of this before we even touched 11pm Not that our intentions were to have a night out there but you don t actually liked to be rushed on your orders and food it just doesn t leave a good experience Possibly the restaurant and it s employees were planning on catching a flight and made sure nothing came in the way The rating is for the food and the place in general Service is a bare minimum ,3.0,1

Gal Punjab Di,I visited this place with my friend It is there right in the heart of Gachibowli s Indiranagar vinayak nagar Upon entering you will definitely feel good and like a family restaurant which it is The ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off There are some corner sittings which many may or may not like and then there were chairs where fitting in was a bit tight Then comes the interaction with the staff They are quite friendly and hard working too They do have a quick serving time but thing is their attire was not up to the mark Menu had a wide variety of items and at some decent rates I really liked the way they split between veg and non veg food We ordered quite a lot of stuff but I really liked the dahi kebab It was good But with such good starter I had pinned my hopes on Patiala lassi But that was an anti climax of sorts They used essence for the lassi I hope they start making more authentic lassi with a malai on top That will surely be a game changer Overall it was a mixed experience and hence 3 5 ,3.0,1

GD's,Ordered from this place since I was on the lookout for a big fat juicy burger They didn t disappoint The Galaxy burger that I ordered was huge The chicken was grilled properly and tasted fine as well The only thing I didn t like I m a fussy eater was that the chicken wasn t a breast piece or some sort of filet It had some loose pieces of fat or skin which I m not fond of and that kinda put me off A pounded chicken breast without all those things in between holding the flesh would have been better Ultimately I took the burger apart and had the bread and chicken separately Taste was good though Still trying to find a burger that can satisfy me ,3.0,1

Eat India Company,A group of 4 we decided to visit this place on Saturday evening The location is quite on the main road however the parking and the entry is terrible They can surely improve in this aspect as it can be a big turn off After entering the restaurant we were quite impressed with the ambience and the decor It had a very India taste to it They had old locks keys doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look Coming to the food there is a plethora of options on their menu Instead of going through it all we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer Hariyali Paneer Tikka and Corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination Corn cubes cannot be missed here My friend ordered a Chicken starter which was quite average though Moving to main course we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries Paneer Lababdar Mushroom curry and Nizami Handi seemed like good choices Food was decent The service was not impeccable It ca surely be improved Also they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal Quite a surprise The price point is a little on the higher side probably much more than average It can be a great negative They accepted gold on food so yay Overall a good experience but probably not one worth visiting again ,3.0,1

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Visited with family for dinner on a special occasion The valet parking was a relief Unfortunately there was no maitre d and we had to seat ourselves The ambience was great I loved the light colours and bright lighting as it put a positive spin on the evening The food was really good The sushi even the veg variant was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb Service however was lacking on all parameters It was cold and inefficient It was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out couple of women in particular could not catch their names The billing too took an unreasonable amount of time The food here is great but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to 3 Quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant Will we return Perhaps not in the near future the only reason we would return at some point would be Zomato Gold on the food ,3.0,1

Hyper Local,Hyper Local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs Despite that it has a reputed name and hype The place is widely spread evenly with three sections Two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area The first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar The two sections are contrasting with each other The bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink Hyper Local has introduced the trending Drunch a sundowner party on Sundays from 3pm to 7pm It includes unlimited food and drinks in Rs 1200 The food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters main course and dessert The drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations Coming to food The menu is inspired from the Delhi region thus has the typical Delhi Street Style starters like Gol Gappe Papdi Chaat Matar Kulche Chole Bhature and Dahi Vade The main course has a subtle style including Thai red curry noodles rice chicken pockets chicken tikka Dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm Drinks were amazing here My personal favourite was Pina Colada Fall Alert and Sangria wine from the menu Hyper Local is also streaming Live IPL matches so its a perfect blend of enjoying the match with food and drinks at your service at a place with lit Ambience Recommended ,3.0,1

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,The Lal Street is been good for the first time Today I went and booked a table where we have not been given a table and was asked to stand at the bar Then after a wait of nearly 40mins staff arranged the table for us where there was no one to entertain us and take our order We sat for around another half hour requesting the waiters to take our order Then suddenly being Saturday night the music went so so loud that it started hurting our ears and we were not able to talk even sitting side by side Everyone want their Saturday night to be groovy but the music was literally hurting our ears No doubt music played by DJ was awesome that it was making everyone dance on the floor Food was fine though but ambience is good ,3.0,1
NorFest - The Dhaba,Well this is the first time I ordered from NorFest The Dhaba I ordered for mutton combo meal which contains rice dal makhani 2 paratha and mutton with a pocket pinch of Rs 400 However very disappointed with the quantity of food At that price range they are not providing a proper portion Moreover the mutton was well cooked but out of 4 small pieces 2 of them had bones and no meat Kindly donot deceive your customers like this with good packaging I gave three star only for the quality ,3.0,1

Arena Eleven,It s during this time of the year where the cricket fanactics are on a lookout for places offering sports screenings and feel almost heartbroken not to find any dedicated sports bar in town But not to worry as Arena Eleven s here to woo the same crowd with their delightful sports themed decor offering big screen match telecasts for sports and all that coming with a beautiful rooftop ambience Located at Level 4 of SLN Terminus Mall in Gachibowli the tagline for the place is Kebabs Beers Sports each of which is incorporated in the menu as well as the setting quite aptly The menu for the place is particularly compact serving only a selective few Indian and Oriental preparations both in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian diets Sampling their vegetarian appetizer from the a la carte section we ended up calling for their Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries both of which turned out to be pretty good The platter came with 3 different tikkas of our choice namely Veg Shami Peri Peri and Lemon Pepper Paneer Tikka on a sizzling hot plate with onions on the base Veg Shami was something that was absolutely mindblowing with a hint of heat both from chili and pepper with the perfectly soft texture Masala Fries was just a Indianized version of loaded fries with the crisp potatoes sauted in with onions ginger and garlic which worked as a good accompaniment for the drinks Non vegetarian section had some really nice dishes including the Tangri Kebab Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka and Honey Chili Chicken Wings which were just perfect for a setting of this kind My personal favourite was their Lemon Pepper Fish however for the juicy and succulent fish chunks giving that lipsmacking balance of citrus and heat from the lemon juice and black pepper marination Honey Chili Wings too were pretty good as a finger food having crispy fried wings tossed in a sticky sweet honey chili sauce probably the best candidate to be had along with a couple of chilled beers Disappointing was their Chili Fish however which had no flavour whatsoever bland pieces of fish with the coating sauce containing just chili without any seasoning The kitchen should probably revisit the recipe and take care in seasoning the fried fish with some salt and pepper Running a buffet on weekends the place offers a beautiful selection of mains to the diners having a variety of Indian options to choose from Each of the diets had two curries on offer with a choice of breads and rice where the non vegetarian sect had Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani along with some delectable Chicken Tikka Biryani After the disappointment in the starters it almost came as a surprise how good both the mains were Chicken Curry had the home style onion base with juicy boneless chicken bites added going absolutely well with some hot Tandoori Rotis Same was the case with Murg Makhani as well however it had a bit too much of sweetness for my taste Trying out their Chicken Tikka Pizza from the a la carte section turned out to be a disaster as the puffy base seemed to be store bought and stale which definitely didn t justify the price tag for the same The dessert options too gave little to choose from where we went for the Gajar ka Halwa and Rice Kheer both of which were plain simple average The service too wasn t any exemplary as the staff almost at all times paid no heed to the diners calling them out for help Getting even a glass of water turned out to be a huge task however on multiple complaints the restaurant manager did mend things well The kitchen deserves appreciation for sending out dishes fast into the dining room however in the pace they almost always lacked consistency The dishes we ordered at the start of the meal when again called brought something entirely different and dreadful on a plate All in all if the place provides a run of the mill menu with a some good dishes but lacking the consistency to deliver entirely instagram com,3.0,1
Dunkin' Donuts,To satisfy my donut craving stopped at this place Ordered some donuts and hazelnut iced coffee I d give a 5 for the donuts as they were delicious but the hazelnut iced coffee was bad it was very diluted and tasted almost like flavored water I love their donuts but drinks should be made properly too please look towards it ,3.0,1

NorFest - The Dhaba,The place is located in the food court of SLN Terminus and the first branch of Norfest in the city The seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole As it was winter we were fortunate to have Makki ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag The Makki ki Roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan Saag was good but lacked salt in it The flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it The next thing was Amritsari Kulcha and Chole a must try and must have at Norfest The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good The final dish was the Paneer Lababdaar and Garlic Naan the curry again lacked salt and was not upto the mark in terms of taste So overall not recommended VFM 4 5 Taste 3 5,3.0,1

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Cascade is a luxury dining restaurant that falls under the notorious Carlson Group of Hotels and offers multi cuisine dishes The tremendous ambiance fully complements the canons of the place and instantly lightens up your mood into musical An addition to the offering is an elaborate buffet for foodies Cascade is in Gachibowli main road It s located on the second floor of the property While the lobby is inviting it only dispels all the doubts about the food being as inviting as the lobby As you enter Cascade you are greeted by a Buddha Statue As soon as you enter their food counter spread all over at the corner side we had a few veg and non veg salad sausage with spinach Started picking one of one and observed fish was stale and seems It was reused The chicken was hard and sausage was almost beginning to wring itself Actually none of the salads were any good partly because they weren t fresh something that is supposed to be figurative of a salad freshness Starters We had veg and non veg soups lots of breads naan roti kulchas Veg starters included paneer tikka potatoes veg mix fried Non veg included couple of chicken items and fish They had little variety of but not so tasty starters Anyway rushed towards main course Dal makhani which was waste Or in another word I was searching for Dal Makhani flavor And I feel in this level of restaurant at least Dal Makhani should be right Moved ahead and tried vegetable dum biryani with Mutton curry I must appreciate mutton curry was yummy and cooked properly but in the same dum biryani could be better For desserts it s a good mix of Indian including Hyderabadi bestseller Double Ka Meetha and European delicacies I am not much of a dessert being but was glad to see a large number of desserts in the buffet Overall I will not call it astonishing stuff but it has wonderful musical spacious place with decent ambiance but they need to improve food side a lot ,3.0,1

Aromas@11SIX,This place is located in khajaguda It used to be one of my favorite places because of the taste quantity and pricing I used to visit this place every weekend or in fact twice a week Food is no doubt good their soups starters dal makhani etc However there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden Prices have been almost doubled I used to have a dal makhani at 180 rs and now its priced at 300 rs I believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost 50 is really a good decision with no changes in ambience I believe their main USP was good food at affordable prices at a decent ambience Even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and Moti Mahal have lower prices and better ambience With hike in prices customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience fancy cutlery on the table well decorated tables and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use well dressed waiters etc Hope the management would rethink ,3.0,1

Prism Club & Kitchen,I have been on Friday night and reached at round 10pm It was almost full we hardly get space for standing They occupied huge space and designed interior amazingly which definitely deserve a cover charge as its into business but one thing which nowhere make sense to taking 500 bucks for just entry out of 2k when every items price also decent to take your business ahead We could not order any snacks except one as we had to carry on hand and could spoil our party mood I must say either they should revoke their concept of charging for entry or should be take responsibility to offer seats atleast when you are visiting as couple or in group Dj was playing good track and it was enjoyable moment we spent Zomato is showing 1200 for two ppl which is really surprising even though you cant step down to this place until unless spend 2k bucks so be aware and keep your pocket tight as this place is not for normal class people ,3.0,1

Owm Nom Nom,I ordered paneer Kulcha but it s not according to my expectations their was only the name of paneer but no paneer ,3.0,1
Beyond Flavours,The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables We went on Friday afternoon We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn t get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer ,3.0,1
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,This is my second visit to this place Like the Ambience much and cool place to chill out Had been there along with a friend for dinner We didn t want to go for Buffet for sure so it was ala carte Angara Murgu Kabab Rara Ghost and Butter Naan Starter was with much salt and lemon Rara Ghost is nice perfection at it s best Was a good combination with Butter Naan Service was very nice and as I said earlier nice ambience ,3.0,1

Prism Club & Kitchen,Prism is touted to be the owner of a huge club space and rightly so The place is located somewhere in Financial District after you take a turn from the Lemon Tree hotel I pretty much had no clue about where I was exactly and the almost stranded road is of not much help Until you suddenly see the big lit up sign with the word Prism inscribed on it though conveniently covered by the bushes around it Another 100m or so you reach their parking yard and finally the enter the premises after it A huge velvety door opens into this big sized covered arena for a lack of better word that tell you that it can never get overcrowded on the dance floor The place has high tables next to the dance area and then some couches on the far side There is a beautifully lit up staircase that leads to a more relaxed lounge kind of seating And that is just one part of it They have an outdoor seating where the projector is put up for the match screening and doubles up as the smoking zone Apart from this they have a pool which would be apt for a private gathering I am no club expert but their light system is sure one of their USP The DJ played majorly Bollywood that evening it was a Wednesday and did a decent enough job While the place is all decked up pretty well the food on offer didn t impress me much STARTERS Burmese Roll with sweet chilli dip A bit too oily they were okay to munch on They could have done with a bit more filling though Punjabi Paneer Tikka with mint dip Failed to impress The paneer was too rubbery in some places and in others too charred The lingering taste was merely of chilli and nothing else MAINS Prism Special Veggie Lover Pizza The dish that fared best with me It was thin crust and had a good amount of cheese For the price it may seem a bit costly but quite worth it as compared to other dishes Spaghetti Their take of spaghetti aglio olio with mushrooms and black olive toppings This was also decent Penne Alfredo This was just regular nothing good or bad And this also goes for the accompanying garlic bread I didn t find the Indian mains anything great and needs to be improved a lot The dessert was another downer Chocolate Truffle was all goey and just cream From the mocktails section I chose the safest bet Go Crazy It was a twist on the oreo shake with the inclusion of KitKat but it wasn t great either Lacked the comfort of a regular oreo shake If you are looking for a party place that has a happening setup good crowd and amazing ambience this is your best bet But for the food it is better you stick with safe bets such as pizzas and pastas They would give you the best value for money The alcohol is also a little pricey but you wouldn t mind that in a place like this ,3.0,1
Dunkin' Donuts,Landed up here on a Saturday night after shopping a couple of stuff Following summaries my experience below Ambiance The ambiance is of a coffee shop and quite a typical one of Dunkin The walls seemed somewhat empty as compared to the Dunkin outlets I have been to in Pune and Mumbai Ample seating for say 30 people 3 5 5 Service You pay at the counter and he will hear your doughnuts and you take them yourself to your seat It is an entirely self service type of mode Nothing extraordinary 3 5 Food We tried the following two doughnuts Kit kat doughnut The doughnut was very fresh but the kit kat taste was okayish not exactly of it The chocolate factor was also less The freshness and the typical dough taste gives this a 4 5 Mango doughnut Literally no taste of mango but again the yummy freshness dough taste which won my heart Just for that 3 5 Will I come here again I like just one here which is Ugly Strawberry Do try that if you like strawberries ,3.0,1
Tandoori Food Works,Order regular paneer tikka briyani from this place which costs rs 250 The briyani was good but the paneer was not so fresh and the quantity was very less It just fills one person stomach if someone s appetite is high then they would regret if they order food from this place There were two sizes small Rs 160 and regular rs 250 Obviously one would think that small fills one person and regular would fill two But No Very disappointed with the portion of food that they serve The Raitha was really tasty I hope they increase the portion for the amount they charge ,3.0,1
The Glass Onion,I went there with my office colleagues The ambience is good The music played is little loud may be volume can be reduced a bit so that we do not need to about while speaking About food quality of food is good but waiters need to be taught that when four people order two different dishes all those to be served at same time What happens was we two finished out veg food and the nob veg waa not even delivered when we finished our veg food We ordered Lotus stem Galouti the taste of Galouti was good but keeping one small kulcha was not going well I know it must be an experiment but I guess it is not working out as it was not going well with Galouti So overall good for one time ,3.0,1

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Great ambiance with very poor service Food 3 5 5 The starters were just OK main course was a little better For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case What disappointed most was the drinks even a classic margarita was not properly made It was orange is color and that is definitely not OK Ambiance 5 5 It definitely stands out for its ambiance Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants Service 2 5 This is where it is most disappointing you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city Price 3 5 It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved Overall would probably visit them again for the ambiance but with the hope that service improves ,3.0,1

Olive Garden,Have been here many times I was a frequent at their madhapur branch since 2006 Its a quiet place and family friendly The lift is old dark and horrible It feels it will breakdown except that it doesn t They tried installing another lift but that turned out to be scarier that the first one Coming to the food Its just okay Nothing outstanding or too bad Starters and Chicken items are usually good enough Their tandoori chicken doesn t have breast portion I couldn t understand the rationale behind it its just leg thigh and wings And yes I don t know why they have downgraded their crockery They serve curries in smaller household type steel bowls ,3.0,1
Chinese Pavilion,Madhumathi Mahajan Well to start with nice courteous servers and staff Excellent serving time all items arrived on time infact for a change had folks asking if we want to hold a little while before getting next dish out These things matter a lot when u r paying to eat out Now food Jade chicken soup nice spinach based creamy stuff gud way to start the meal Accompanied by house salad of cabbage and cucumber kimchi nice dressing but cabbage cut could have been good Fish cakes were good loved it and accompanying sauces were awesome Main course was Mix XO rice of chicken and prawn well that was the downer Nothing exciting abt it maybe shld have coupled with a curry but then Nash fried rice u shld be able to enjoy dry Desert blue berry cheesecake so here is where me and wifey differ I thght it was worth it she says the base wasn t crunchy engh So try and rate yourself Last ambience was warm n eye soothing Oh and I forgot the orange pekoe tea the best I had in lat few months Have it,3.0,1

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Visited Urban Asia based on their rating and reviews However we were utterly disappointed We visited the Gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with East India Co The waiter handed us the Signature menu and that is when the ordeal began Most of the signature dishes were unavailable It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu Eventually we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650 Overall a disappointing evening ,3.0,1
Desi Bytes,Its an open space eating place famous for their litti chokha Although they have a range of options to order Recommend this place if you want to try litti chokha They serve it with chokha and 3 types of chutni The service is very slow so you need to be really active to ensure that your order is through ,3.0,1

Pista House,Heard a lot about the place and had clean and nice food delivered at home So I finally decided to pay a visit to the place myself High Expectations The place was nowhere near what I had imagined The restaurant wasn t a very neat and hygienic place the plates were dirty and the cutlery and sauce storage boxes tainted and dirty The people there were not welcoming too and their uniforms were half tucked in Moving on to the good part the food was cleaner than most non veg places in Hyderabad with the Chicken having a little less oil than most places The desserts looked sumptuous even though I was full for them I manged to take some pictures of them So from now on I am just going to get myself a delivery from that place rather than actually going there and if I go there it would be for the sole purpose of trying out the desserts ,3.0,1
