Prism Club & Kitchen,An evening well spent at Prism club and Kitchen The place is situated relatively outside the main city in Financial district and has a huge area to offer One can enjoy Poolside as well as at the sitting which is offered near the Dance floor With big live screens and a great DJ there is a lot of entertainment that you can expect out of the place Started my food experience with their Appetizers I tried out their Punjabi Paneer tikka Fish Finger Lehsooni Murgh tikka and Veg Burmese rolls The Punjabi Paneer tikka was good It had an exquisite flavor to it which was top notch Served along with Onion salad and traditional mint chutney one can give this dish a shot Next up their Fish fingers were quite normal for my palate They could improve the side dip and can use tartar dip as an option My favorite dish of the night was their Lehsooni Murgh tikka It had a really fantastic smoky flavor of garlic flakes to it and was super tender The spice mix was really complimenting the chicken and is a must try for you all Veg Burmese rolls was a big disappointment for me It had some extra oil to it which could have been clearly avoided They need to work on the filling as well as the outer crust of the rolls For their drinks I tried out their Cosmopolitan Margarita and Passion All the drinks were simply wonderful It was truly a great experience overall to have the right kind of drinks at this place For mains I had their Exotic vegetables in Black pepper sauce with Rice Farmer Chicken pizza Penne white sauce pasta Exotic vegetables in Black pepper sauce was good I usually don t like to have this at most outlets due to the overpowering taste of the Black pepper sauce but somehow these guys served it very well alongside some Rice Their Farmer Chicken pizza was too good Loved the overall consistency of the dish A slight work needs to be put up in their Pasta I didn t find it much cheesy and tasty The place setup is quite big and they certainly have a good potential to improve on their food Great place for partying for sure Happy eating ,4.0,2
Karachi Bakery,If you are in Hyderabad you must have visited and tasted it s biscuits cookies and desserts Now cookies and desserts cakes and pastries are great no doubt in that Coming to ice creams which they introduced recently well it was not good and one more thing is their packed snacks namkeen I think it s not up to the price Rest ambience and lighting is great Nice place to sit and hangout ,4.0,2
Biryanis And More,Visited this place for the first time Tried gongura mutton biryani and Tuglaq biryani Both the dishes tasted decent but they didn t justify the biryani tag line Tuglaq biryani tasted more of Pulav and it nowhere can stand near biryani The amount of meat given is not on par with the money you shed Ambience is decent and the staff are quite courteous ,4.0,2

Club Rogue,Over all good experience but Cons Entry ONLY for ppl who show corporate ID is kinda too much And also rude behaviour of bouncers Instead of making us feel safe they themselves scares the customers Pros Price for alcohol and food is at its best and the inside ambience is amazing The way DJ plays music is awesome He makes even non dancers to dance till their body aches and also crowd is amazing,4.0,2

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,What an ambience It was a Saturday evening on which we visited this place It has got that stock market price fluctuation system for beverages We could order ourselves from the app The Lal Street to be read as Dalal street where the stock exchange is actually listed In terms of food we ordered two preparations Cheese Chilly Toast was well prepared but had a lot of chillies The Lal Special Pizza was not upto the mark coming from a reviewer from Kolkata If you hit the right price alcohol can be really cheap We ordered Black Dog Triple Gold Reserve for around 180 INR It s definitely a bang on party place which requires a little improvement when it comes to food ,4.0,2

Dunkin' Donuts,It took me so long to pen down this review 6 days to be exact And why you ask Well that s because I had to taste 6 donuts in all Yess I decided to try the festive Rakhi donut box that comes with 6 mini Donuts ranging from death by chocolate chocolate filled mango flavored two classics etc All this priced at Rs 199 plus taxes This roughly came out to Rs 243 So much goodness in one box Now I can t name each of the Donuts but I can say that majority were chocolate based Of the 6 donuts 2 were classic style and rest 4 were filled ones The first one was the classic sugar coated Simple and goody good The second one was a chocolate coated classic donut This one was fine Next up the mango flavored one This one had a mango glaze on top and center filled with mango puree or jam This was a fresh taste after so much chocolate The fourth one I think was death by chocolate This one had a delicious chocolate coating on top and center filled with gooey chocolate The fifth one had a chocolate topping but cream filling This one was ok The last one again had a chocolate topping and a vanilla filling This one was good The topping had some sprinkles too All in all a sinful treat for all donut heads out there Definitely a must try Breaking away from my usual style of writing I will come to the location and ambience after the food So this outlet is located on the ground floor of SLN terminus Very easy to locate The board is visible from the road The interiors like other Dunkin Donuts outlets is quirky with pop colour furniture and interesting wall designs On a Sunday afternoon the place was moderately crowded Service was good No issues there Would love to visit again ,4.0,2

Faasos,First things first Faasos have always been the first name that comes to mind when it comes to huge sized Appetite fulfilling wraps I haven t come across any other place which delivers these kind of huge juicy warps with this amount of filling Tried their cheesy chicken jumbo wrap and chicken jumbo wrap and believe me you ll be full to your throat with just one wrap Besides the quantity they also maintain quality with the wraps being flavourful and cheesy Overall if you are looking for NO SALAD only chicken wraps which are my kind of things faasos won t disappoint you for sure ,4.0,2

Arena Eleven,Rating 3 5 Replacing Serafina Arena Eleven is a new addition to the SLN Terminus mall With TV screens playing different kinds of sports and walls adorned with sports memorabilia the place is a crowd puller during this IPL season The place is well lit and has a long deck that gives you a beautiful view of the botanical garden Our Sunday lunch started with a few drinks Mint Julep Virgin Mojito Virgin Sangria Virgin Pina Colada Zen Zero a mojito like drink with cola Calvados their version of a hot toddy Old fashioned and Kentucky Apple Cinnamon Though the cocktails were potent they lacked finesse Mocktails in most cases were either too sweet or watered down The better ones of the lot were Calvados Apple Cinnamon and Mint Julep In the starters we tried their sizzling tikka platter that had an assortment of regular chicken lemon pepper malai nasheman paneer and fish tikkas The stand out ones here were the fish and lemon pepper tikkas We also tried their Tangdi kebab salt and pepper prawns chili fish salt and pepper wings chicken 65 honey chili wings chicken lollipop in hot garlic sauce masala fries chicken and veg sheek kebabs One thing we noticed in these starters was the lack of consistency Our first round of the veg sheek kebab was amazing which led us to order more The second round was super disappointing as the kebab was dry and tasteless The tangdi kebab was well made Soft and juicy chicken marinated well and cooked to perfection in a tandoor The chili fish and fish tikka too were super delicious I visited this place twice During the first visit I tried the Chicken peri peri tikka roll Chicken Rajiala Onion Kulcha and Thai Green Chicken curry for mains The roll was passable We were told that the chicken rajiala was a star on their menu but it didn t really prove to be It tasted like a regular buffet green chicken curry Nothing special The thai green chicken curry blew us off with it s flavors Each of the flavors in the dish could be tasted individually but when they came together it was magic Pairing it with some hot steamed rice elevated it further and left of licking our spoons During the second visit we chose to eat the mains from their Sunday buffet and it was not a great decision Except a few dishes like the chicken curry and chicken tikka biryani the rest were tasteless We also ordered a chicken butter masala pizza that had a pre made base and tasted substandard We ordered a portion of the green curry again which utterly disappointed us by being too sweet They only had a couple of desserts in both instances Gajar Halwa and Rice Kheer They were just run of the mill kind and didn t have any oomph factor Overall one thing that the place needs is consistency Their tag reads Kebabs Beer Sports but the kebabs part isn t really justified Service is decent They need quite a few improvements to keep up with the pace They have some really pocket friendly happy hours and the place is awesome during sunset Taste 3 5 Ambiance 4 5 Service 3 5 5 Value for Money 3 5 5,4.0,2

PourHouse7,At Gachibowli we have a new rooftop dining place which captures the astonishing view of Hyderabad s new side overlooking the mighty IKEA We dined at Pourhouse7 where they house a club too at the floor below the rooftop It was drop dead gorgeous view from there and the weather was cold with chill winds so we had to put our jackets back on But on a regular evening the place would be warm They have been serving us some nice cocktails and some punchy mocktails like chatpata masala The starters were not that great and needs much improvement They had chicken manchow soup and coriander soup which were really bleak and the place won t be expecting much orders on them as it s a bar The Hyderabadi Tawa Fish was exceptionally great and turned out to be my favourite of the night In the vegetarian department I ll recommend Tandoori Broccoli Further to the main course the Tangadi kebab was perfectly cooked juicy chicken legs The masalas of Cashew nut chicken and chicken tikka were soo tasty They were an amazing combination with the rotis The place has improve a lot on a handful of starters and rest will be taken care of Food 3 5 Ambience 4 5 5 Service 3 5 Value for money 3 5,4.0,2
Arena Eleven,Arena Eleven is a relatively new addition to the concept of sports bar in the city Located inside the SLN terminus it attracts a relatively young crowd living in the nearby IT hubs I went over there to try out their Weekend Buffet First things first their Buffet layout was well spread The starters were served on the table accompanied by an array of curries and rice dishes to choose from The drinks offered by them included Mojito Zen Zero and Mint Julep The drinks were average and needs quite improvement Speaking about their starters I had their Chicken Tangdi Malai Paneer tikka Salt and Pepper prawns Lemon pepper Chicken tikka Mutton Seekh kebab and Veg Seekh kebab Amongst all the starters I loved their Chicken tangdi kebab The chicken was super juicy and was cooked to perfection The use of proper marination was quite evident in the taste of the meat Next up I also liked their Lemon pepper Chicken tikka It had a subtle flavor of lemon all thanks to the dominating flavor of the pepper For mains the spread comprised of two chicken main course dishes two veg main course dishes accompanied by Dal Assorted breads Biryani and Salads The chicken dishes were Chicken curry and Chicken tikka masala I found both the curries simply wonderful just because of the fact that they were tasting much like home cooked chicken For veg their was Mutter Paneer and Paneer butter masala I liked their Mutter Paneer as it was really balanced in terms of flavor Their Biryani was a slight disappointment for me It could have been much more flavorful and the use of boneless chicken didn t really serve justice to the dish Apart from this I also had my hands on their Veg thai curry It was served with steamed rice To be honest the preparation of Thai Green Curry was too good but the only thing which upset me was that it was sweeter than the normal version Maybe they can work upon the use of Cocunut cream in the curry For desserts I had their Gajar ka Halwa Kheer and Ice cream The desserts were pretty much ordinary and needs ample improvement all together All in all the place has got a huge potential All they need to do is to work upon slight glitches in their drinks and few main course items Happy eating ,4.0,2

Hyderabadi Daawat,I have always been a fan of regional cuisines of India for their immense depth in terms of culture as well as tradition And its not just the flavours on the taste buds its almost as if you could taste the history of a civilization And with the imprint Nizams have left on the city of Hyderabad in every aspect it doesn t even come as a surprise as to why there are an unnumerable amount of dishes in Hyderabadi cuisine Hyderabadi Dawaat is one new joint in Gachibowli area which is trying to bring back the cuisine of Nizams by serving dishes from our very favourite Hyderabadi cuisine to the best of its authenticity From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis the menu for the place is full of culinary delights Coming to the food I went in for a dinner to sample out their menu with some of my friends where we began the meal with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba which was a flavour pumped version of a simple mutton shorba and an awesome start to the meal With every sip the flavour became increasingly intense with the hearty mutton tartness on the back of the tongue Then came an array of appetizers both for the veg as well as non veg From the vegetarian ones I personally loved the Achaari Paneer Tikka which had soft pieces of paneer marinated in a balanced pickle spice mix which had just the right amount of tanginess to it From the non vegetarian menu there were quite a few who made to my favourites including the Murgh Kalmi Kebab chicken leg pieces marinated heavy handedly in spice and finished in tandoor to perfection Gosht Seekh Kebab plain old mutton kebabs with juicy succulent mutton mince and Patrani Fish fish covered in a subtle coconut based marinade wrapped in cabbage and finished in tandoor From among the specialties from the area the restaurant presented us with their Sikandari Rann which was a whole leg of lamb marinated with whole spices like cloves cinnamon pepper and cashew nut finished slowly in a tandoor and served on a bed of fried onions and garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side Each element of the dish was beautiful with the lamb taking the center stage tender juicy and delicious In a similar fashion restaurant also serves specialty big platters like Chelo Kebabs which is a Persion styled serving of Mutton and Chicken Kebabs on a bed of Saffron Rice and Murg Mussallam which had a whole chicken doused in a delicious ginger garlic marinade and cooked till tender served again on a bed of rice Even after the Rann the show wasn t over and we went in for mains trying out their Gosht Masala Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which went really well with some hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans Nargisi Kofta was my favourite one which had the same delicious mutton keema wrapped around boiled eggs and tossed in a rich spicy onion tomato gravy Gosht Masala was a tiny bit more spicier that the Kofta and had flavourful bone in mutton pieces With the Achari Chicken the restaurant again showed excellence in terms of balance of flavour as the dish wasn t too tangy as preparations in most of the other restaurants turn out to be Gil e Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal with a sweet note both of which were less of sugar and actually quite good The service here at Hyderabadi Dawaat was just as good as their food The staff was warm and corteous and took care of each and every need for us diners be it a glass of water or a change of plates I was highly impressed with the kitchen which though took time to deliver the dishes to the table but also put in extreme care to provide us only what was the best In a nutshell if you want to experience the true cultural heritage of Hyderabad on a plate Hyderabadi Dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list instagram com,4.0,2

American Wild Wings,American Wild Wings is another fast food joint located amidst the Cream Stone outlet of Gachibowli The place is open and has an ideal sitting space for 20 30 people Went there with my friends to try out their food I found their Ambiance quite ordinary and I felt it can get some makeover Starting with their appetizers We first tried out their in house Chicken wings So the chicken wings served over here are classified into various types They offer a wide range of sauces for their wings ranging from classic Texas BBQ Pattaya Thai Spicy Garlic Amazon wild etc My personal favorite of the lot had to be Original hot Chicken wings and Mexican wild Chicken wings The wings were super juicy and delicious However I also feel that the sauce content was too much for the wings which can be slightly reduced in order to make it taste perfect Next up we had their Classic Chicken Nuggets and Popcorn Chicken The nuggets were super tasty and very much similar to what we usually get to eat at all fast food outlets The Popcorn chicken was chewy It requires serious attention and changes For mains the place has also introduced authentic Indian dishes such as Chicken Biryani with Salan Raita and Gongura Chicken The Gongura Chicken was an absolute relish To my surprise the meat fell of the bone quite nicely and it worked really nicely with the clean flavors of the Biryani Thanks for a wonderful time Mr Srinivas Moreover this place is comparatively quite pocket friendly and can be given a shot for their Chicken Wings anyday Happy eating ,4.0,2

NorFest - The Dhaba,The spare get five in this judging world where every mere mortal including me set about while writing a review scrutinize every bite we took and every sense we had On such a rare occasion i commemorate this restaurant with invisible gardens and gold because it definitely is worth spending your hard earned me for a sensation like this Since the time i shifted to Hyderabad i have had trouble finding the less is more concept in a restaurant Spicy hot and tangy became a common thing And here comes Norfest like a strong and quiet gallant hero who quietly watches the bustle in the world and only comes when called upon The mutton galauti kebabs took me back to the streets of husainganj in lko where street food sellers scream in the humid heat ushering people to come in to their food haven It was soft and melting in your mouth and i didnt have to be physically placed in lko again The nuts on top were a nice touch We also ordered for a non veg thali which had butter chicken and I a slow eater finished it in seconds I still remember the taste in my mouth tandoori chicken soft and creamy gravy with warm rice The dal makhani i presumed would have the sane taste as the butter chicken but it had a more coherent flavor of the dal and solely made with the lentil and no rajma was added I a pure non vegetarian became a fan of the veggie curry with cooked capsicums carrots and corn The gravy enveloping it was amazing The thali was so well packed that nothing had spilled out and touched any other item when i opened it The kheer was the perfect stop for this sensations insued trip It was sweet the rice had formed a beautiful serene sort of bond with the milk and the saffron gave it a nice fresh touch Talking about it i am definitely reordering it tomorrow Kudos,5.0,2

The Glass Onion,I will start off by talking about it s ambience and location which I believe and am sure most will agree are it s highlights Located inside the serenity of Boulder hills away from the hullabaloo of the busy city it offers a sense of calm The simple yet elegant decor is what clicked for me right from the moment I walked in It has both and indoor and outdoor sitting The indoor sitting though comfortable and well lit I would suggest the outdoor one simply because of the view it has to offer The streches of green pasture of the golf club adjacent to it and the mild breeze that blows across it definitely refreshes your soul as you sit sipping on your drink I visited it on a summer evening and it was a pleasant experience to say the least Now coming to the food and beverages part definitely a little on the bulkier side but you got to expect that from a place like this located in the midst of all VIP locality The cocktails are good and do ask the waiter for in house food specialities which may not be mentioned in the menu And yes they have a novel concept of High tea served along with alcoholic beverages which is served during the early hours of the evening 4 7 pm with the set up they have I believe this is a must try Overall it s a nice place to spend a quiet afternoon or evening with family or friends P S Don t go there looking for dance and high pitch music you might be disappointed ,4.0,2

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Our first experience with Urban Asia was pretty average however since then every time we visited this place it has been beyond satisfactory The first time although the food was good the experience was impacted by very poor service long wait time without any clear information of the duration and disastrous preparation of one of the items the name of which I don t remember unfortunately The establishment houses two different restaurants Eat Street and Urban Asia under the same roof and without any strict boundary You can choose to sit anywhere you please depending on availability The service usually is prompt and courteous Overall ambiance is decent with touches of fun in the form of comments written on the wall Since we love Asian Cuisine the food is the highlight for us and although all the items we tried during our multiple visits are excellent I would like to specially mention the Nasi Goreng We have tried it in many restaurants in India besides having it in Bali and this place comes closest to match the authentic taste and presentation Susi was also excellent very fresh and delicious We would definitely be visiting again and strongly recommend for fellow foodies ,4.0,2

Aromas@11SIX,Review No 514 In my recent visit to Hyderabad I was introduced to Aromas 11Six While the name sounds interesting but I was not able to find the reason behind their name Our teams in Hyderabad have been ordering food from here for team events etc for quite some time and hence when we ordered food from here I was keen to find out how they fared Here s what we ended up ordering over a few days from Aromas 11Six Gosht Rogan Josh What a beautiful preparation of spices and meat The meat in specific was cooked very well and the spices were also within moderation I usually get scared with the spice level in such dishes but Aromas 11Six got it absolutely right with this dish Butter Rotis Even when they were delivered to us at home and as well in the office they were warm and soft Nothing beats such a meal on an unusual cold Hyderabad winter evening Paneer Butter Masala The quality of the Paneer used was excellent The quantity of the gravy and the paneer pieces were adequate I loved the consistency of the gravy and the balance in the spices used Dal Fry Again in many instances I have seen how it can go easily wrong with this humble dish Thank you for serving this up well Paneer Biryani On of the days I could not have non veg food and ended up ordering their Paneer Biryani and it was filling to the core The quality of the rice and preparation was nice Thank you for not being stingy with the Paneer See if you can check for some good combos on popular food app portals That way you can try this great dish and club it with something else as well Price In line with the competition They have tie ups with some of the popular food apps and hence sometimes we end up getting a good deal Service They have ensure we always got our orders within the stipulated time in spite of the rush in the orders especially during dinner time Ambience We have only done take aways from here and hence going to leave this neutral Here s the final ratings basis my experience at Aromas 11six I m going to hold back a bit on the ratings because they have depth in their Menu and I would want to try them out more and perhaps revisit my ratings again in the near future Food 4 5 Price 4 5 Service 4 5 Ambience 3 5 Our review has been based only on home delivery and hence keeping this neutral Overall 4 5 Implied rating of 4 on Zomato ,4.0,2

Faasos,Zomato has asked me to be polite ok Faasos is delightfully bad in its food quality When you order a pizza roll they not only bake it like a pizza but they take it to the next level of master culinary skills They roast it till the end just like how your mumma used to make it and best part comes next Faasos excels in giving surprises and since they handle their own delivery you can never know when your food is going to arrive It s too much fun to see that status Food is being prepared Your food is in the kitchen and they won t update it because the delivery person can come any moment to your doorstep and say Surprise In my case they were quick enough to deliver it in only 1 hour 30 minutes So fast da then I remembered food should have been delivered only in 40 minutes I asked delivery person why so much late da He said sir we were cooking your roll property that s why it took time open it and try it sir you would have never seen such roll And he was right I never saw the roll only charcoal attached picture for reference ,1.0,0

Hyper Local,Oh my God what a horrible place They have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar And in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside They serve cocktails but I would rather drink water than those cocktails 4 of us ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks Cocktails including lit a glass of Ice and very little juice cost 650 sotb a glass of Ice with a little of some another juice old fashion even smaller glass of Ice with a slice of orange and pinacolada this I ve no idea what they put for the white color apart from that it was bad juice again 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high All this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom Again that being said when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me we had two zomato gold discounts when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2 2 discout the answer strangely was because its the highest priced drink did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer when I implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected During all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations I guess that too is the part of the cheating plan Be aware people Avoid this place ,1.0,0

Labonel,Definitely a very popular bakery in hyderabad and for a good reason Amazing cakes and brownies It is one of those high end classy bakeries in town with a well established fan base who would vouch for it forever My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them I didn t like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people s taste Brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes ,3.5,0

Pot Pourri, Writing this review as soon as I got out of the restaurant From the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience Left right after starters I wouldn t even care to rate it one star One of worst restaurants to dine in I think it ll be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more the After reaching at 2 PM there was no receptionist After the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people It was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged That s it A piece of advise to y all if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there Neither proper AC chambers nor proper cooling It was HOT Thanks POT POURRI for understanding and making our dining uncomfortable After we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we re opting for veg or non veg By this time I was already wondering if they thought we re idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want I just realised that it was true After soup and buttermilk starters were served PAINFULLY SLOW It took MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR THEM TO FINISH SERVING JUST 6 STARTERS Were they kidding me They wasted my precious time and this isn t what a customer wants If you can t give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere We had to school the waiters regarding their service then we spoke to their leader I guess and he also gave the same old typical answer sorry I ll just get that served for you We don t want no sorry You can t placate us with sorry for our time hard work and money spent After seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to sorrys I decided to leave the restaurant After all this HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE US THE COMPLETE BILL It was 1100 It wasn t even worth it even if we had the whole menu After arguing he decided to give 10 discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we had Wouldn t suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant Starters I found the starters to be normal good in quality Not very impressive nor was menu standing out If you pay 100 200 more you ll be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food 1 Soup we were served chicken soup It wasn t impressive It was fine 2 Buttermilk under drinks it was tasty 3 Chicken tikka it was ok It was hard sometimes soft 4 Ajwani paneer tikka it was very good in taste 5 Kodi vepudu it was chicken with common known marination I mean it felt like typical Indian curry It was just good 6 Fried veg green chilli it was just ok in taste Couldn t make out if it s actually chilly 7 Corn fried fish it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste Probably this is the only best thing there 8 Crispy corn corn was crispy as expected and tasted good Main course I found it to be typically common Nothing new if you ve been to buffets before Accompaniments were regular papad curd naan roti Desserts not much varieties What s there is menu is served Ambience I don t care about ambience as long as food is good and my patience isn t tested ,1.0,0

Cafe Eclat,Update Just wanted to make sure the cafe would know I am reverting my rating to a 1 coz your staff s issue with the payment caused me a ton of pain now To make a long story short you guys charged me twice on the same day and then charged me the same amount after almost 3days of visiting your cafe Now thanks to that my bank decided my card has been compromised and blocked my card My account went into negative balance you guys decided to charge me thrice overall and refund me once my card is blocked and i am pissed Truly a nightmare experience all because i choose your establisment by mistake Old review This place was on my bookmark list for a while and I was excited to visit it on Saturday We ordered a mushroom quiche a primavera pizza and a grilled vegetable panini The mushroom quiche was alright but what knocked me out was the price It was a relatively small piece with a spoon of caramalized onions and a small amount of onions and salad and they charge 150 rupees for that The pizza was about 9 inches and tasted alright But its a whopping 500 rupees The grilled panini is pretty much the same I know the restaurant is all about european cuisine but they dont have to make their prices european as well I had pizzas or quiche that tasted a lot better at a cheaper price Dont get me wrong the food isnt horrible but its alright But it does feel bitter after you pay the bill lol,1.0,0

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,This outlet has been secluded from the limelight of the Kondapur gachibowli stretch but still manages to garner a decent amount of crowd The ambiance is pretty ambivalent with that of a buffet restaurant and casual dining space It was well lit but could really deck up a few notches It was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant Upon arrival were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation We were asked if we are here for buffet The restaurant it seems is more concentrated on buffet I had a look at the menu and it didn t interest me The manager at this place was a nice fellow Who carefully took our order of dragon chicken punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan After a fair bit of waiting time we re served with dragon chicken I would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry so that the flavours stick to the chicken It was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation The servers need to be taught a little bit about serving They were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers Then we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan Simply put it was a disaster The curry was as bland as it could be Most restaurants in this part of India assume that all dishes of Punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief We could only experience the tandoori chicken as the curry had no taste of its own It was just sitting there doing nothing Neither it was spicy not it was tangy It was going nowhere The problem here doesn t lie with the chefs It lies with the restaurant which is confused in what they are trying to do They say they are multi cuisine but multi cuisine doesn t mean you can make disaster dishes and pass them off I am not a fan of multi cuisine When you have such a title you should at least try to make it work for you The restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant North Indian population or the traditional South Indian population One thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their Buffet menu They tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion Had the restaurant been a traditional southern one I would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content The restaurant needs to find its footing The owners need to decide which way they want to go Maybe hire some traditional North Indian guys for North cuisine Ambience 3 Taste 2 Service 2 Value for money 2,2.0,0
Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Komatose on a Sunday night is the perfect place to be happened to be drizzling which made for the perfect atmosphere to chill outside in the cabanas Inside was a pretty small area for a bar but had loads of seating space which extended out to a floor above overlooking the area below Lighting was funky and great the vibrant colors adding to the vibe Being a big bunch we ordered different drinks and luckily I got to taste all The most special of these were from the 7 deadly sins of Koma menu The taste was as described on the menu Lust in particular was something different I d never tasted before a chilli spiced vodka strawberry infusion The appetizers we had we re really good something I enjoyed more than the alcohol Dragon prawns Grilled pomfret Peshawar Chapali Kebabs are some of the must orders Didn t quite like the Nawabi Shikhampuri While all the items tasted great I felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price Best for the last not being a kid here but the mocktails were just mind blowing Had a few different fruit flavors peach mango green apple lime out of which the peach was the best Multiple rounds of that gave me the sugar rush The service was professional and quick Would ve wished for better music and there was no DJ at the music station However we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great It s a perfect place to watch a match screening have a party or if you re in the mood for it go into Comatose Here s my overall SCORE Food 3 5 5 Ambience 3 5 5 VFM 3 5 5 Service 3 5 5,3.5,0

Labonel,When we order something special for a loved ones birthday apart from the value there are always sentiments attached to it My sister aspires to start her own bakery and holds Labonel Fine Baking in high regard Keeping this in minds we thought a Labonel cake will make her birthday more special We ordered the cake 1 week in advance and had confirmed the order the previous day We also spoke to them the very same day we were supposed to pick up the cake Both the times we were informed by their staff that the store is open on 23rd Sept till 6pm this is after you ignore the fact that their official timing is 7pm They decide to call me on the day of pickup at 4 50pm to inform me that they will shut down at 5 30pm So not only was i expected to drop whatever i was doing at a moment s notice i believe they expected me to teleport to their store Well since the cake held sentimental value for me I did leave immediately and rushed to the Gachibowli store I made it there by 5 10pm and can you imagine my dismay when I saw that the store was closed To add to it no one answered the phone I stood there for 30 minutes trying to get in touch with them on multiple phone numbers on the website but there was no response I could not believe that a renown place could be this unprofessional If they cannot value their customers and have no regard for others time and sentiments I do not think it would ever matter how their product is My sister no longer considers them a role model as she values her customers more than having a fancy store with expensive products Since they did not contact me back even the next day I feel the only option left then is to complain on social media and hence this post I hope this falls on deaf ears of Labonel owners I know I will not be repeating the mistake of ordering something from this place and to anyone who reads this you have been warned Update I have a facebook post which certifies that minimum 5 friends of mine have dealt with similar bad experiences ,1.0,0

The Glass Onion,It was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place I reserved a table for us on the same day itself To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had I was delighted to see the place at first Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us after reserving the table and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner like local restraunts and they gave us the menu The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side the food was not worth the price it tasted more like any other local restraunt The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland it was sweet and barely had any flavour seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us overall a bad experience verdict on the face of it the ambience was nice the service and food were not upto the mark Very dissappointing indeed ,1.0,0

Club Rogue,I am thinking where to start there were so many bad experiences at this place in just 2 3 hours of time we spent there We were a group of 8 we decided upon this place after looking at the reviews and on recommendation of someone who had visited a few months before us To start with the place does not have well groomed and professional staff they hardly understand what you speak The first bad experience was when we entered and got ourselves seated on a large table meant for 10 we were 6 at that time and 2 more expected to join us As soon as we got seated a waiter came to us and asked us to take a smaller table as this one is meant for 10 people we told him that we are expecting 2 more to join shortly but he insisted we take a smaller table as crowd would start coming it was not even 6 PM then and there was hardly anyone at that time other than the 6 of us We told him that incase more crowd comes we will move Secondly we ordered for drinks and those were served in plastic glasses when we asked for glass ones the waiter they don t have any We had to literally fight for glass tumblers and they did it very reluctantly The service was slow we had to keep looking for waiters We were there during happy hours and were told it ends at 7 PM but the waiters stopped taking orders at 6 50 PM saying by they serve it would cross 7 PM Doesn t that sound ridiculous Again they started serving in plastic glasses and we were demanding the glass ones when the argument was not stopping I suggested my friends that we should go to 10D to which the waiter present said we should go to 10D they use glass tumblers after he said that we demanded meeting the Manager The Manager came and he was a nightmare he did not have the courtesy to apologize on behalf of the waiter and started arguing with us when we said we will give bad rating review the Manager said Ok Sir we are also dangerous people we were shocked at this Our evening was spoilt already so we decided to move out of there and go elsewhere This place is not at all professional the staff and their business ethics are horrible will never visit ever ,1.0,0

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Amid the busy lanes of financial district lies this serene place with lots of greenery and makes one feel pleasant on the outset A little ahead when you walk through the lobby lies this very spacious restaurant Very well managed place I must say Spacious well lit with the usage of a lot of natural lighting The AC temperature was a tad bit on the higher side which was informed to one the the staff but didn t find much difference even after informing Service was slow and a little out of place We asked if they could get milkshakes as we had kids with us The lady who went to check this has never returned or answered the query Next we found the glasses a little smelly which we asked to be replaced But was never done The rotis took a lot of time to come Clearing the used plates took way too long despite informing multiple times Asked for shawarmas and some food from the live counters which never happened or only a part of it was served Requested for the dessert section to be extended a little further but again took away without informing Coming to the food there s loads of choice Except for a few items on the menu nothing is worth a Hyatt standard Loved the ariselu live counter Shawarmas tasted bland and could not take more than one bite Mutton curry was too oily and no meat in it It was filled with bones Also liked the varieties of rice available Overall a place that could be so much more than what it currently is If only this was better managed it has the potential to be the best ,2.0,0

PourHouse7,March 15th Had to change my rating to 1 today the worst service ever My table is right across the bar and no one cared to take an order till half an hour The staff doesn t know a thing about service Tables are unclean and stick As usual the stupid DJ is Soo loud but it got better later Poor maintainince of the place adds to everything I literally had to go and shout to have someone take my order Waiter is so absent minded Imagine not even getting a glass of water for 40mins The poor manager had to wait tables and supply cutlery to the required people Some waiters were just standing there and enjoying music as if they own the place There was this one particular guy who was soo arrogant that he started back talking and arguing It was a really pathetic experience and I would definitely choose a different place next time Special mention to Dharmender who was very attentive I haven t tasted much of their menu but the white sauce penne pasta was average I expected it to be more flavorful and have consistent creamy texture but it wasnt The chicken wings were a little sweet and not that great if you want to have some spicy good to go with your drinks The only thing I liked about the place was that it stocked Kalhua which was out of stock at almost all other places The seating could be arranged better seats weren t that comfortable and I keep hurting my knees Everytime I make a move The music DJ was exceptionally loud and not pleasant at all If you can please get the DJ to reduce the volume at least during peak dinner hours I couldn t hear anything my colleagues sitting across the table were speaking ,1.0,0

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,As the name suggests its supposed to be a Marriott and that s what you expect The reality is very different Let s start with my experience even before reaching I was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool And so I did I was denied reservation saying that it s really full but they finally said they can get me one table I was happy It has a separate entrance in SLN terminus with it s own parking and valet which is real comfortable Now let s talk real business Upon Reaching I see the place completely empty Maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty I didn t understand why they had to do play so hard to get Even by the time we left the place was hardly even half full The whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside Ambience the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest It s very mediocre Staff THE WORST SERVICE EVER I have had better service in small restaurants or even small Dhabas if I may compare them I had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come There is an inside seating and outside we took the inside because it was too noisy out I asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me Andar koi nahi baithta No one sits inside If you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open There was a buffet and we went for it now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there We had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to Being a Marriott you d expect some decent service they said if I m paying with card I have to come to the billing counter and pay there Such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel Food There was hair in the food Starters were okay but main course was very bad And let me make special note of the dessert If I m coming for a buffet in such a place I d expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop They bought kaaju kathli Rasgulla Some barfi among some cake etc And no spoons to take them had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert Next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view I ve attached pictures After paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went When we tried to Express our grief that waiter manager just blatantly shut me off I m not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place It was the most disappointing experience I ever had in Hyderabad Marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property I will for sure NEVER come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here ,1.0,0

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Was visiting my in laws for the first time To celebrate the occasion we came here after more than hour long drive And oh boy did this place disappoint Not only did they lack the basic services like serving Papad and water in the beginning they made blunders like serving Long Island Ice tea to a pregnant woman instead of the lemon ice tea that she ordered We were a group of 11 people and were seated in a private room We had to keep going out of the room to call the waiters only to be responded with an arrogant attitude especially by the restaurant manager Parmeshwar from Lucknow Each order took a long time to come and was served cold And when I say served I don t mean served by them Oh no the waiters simply kept all the dishes on one side of the table and left it to us to serve ourselves Despite of this on lack of better judgment we made a horrible mistake of ordering the dessert which we just left after a bite because it was that bad Needless to say our night was ruined and to end it all just when we thought it can t get any worse they over billed us We spent 20 mins to get it corrected The icing on the cake was the charged us for the Long Island Ice Tea as well Please avoid this place at all costs And you ll be saving a LOT You ll also save yourselves from mosquito bites because they ll refuse to provide you with a mosquito repellent when you ask for it P S If you re a cheese enthusiast please don t make the same mistake of ordering the cheese platter as we did For 600 they served us stale cheese with few almonds crackers and 2 apricots Whoever originally came up with this dish must have shifted somewhere n his her grave when these people had the audacity to serve something like this to us ,1.0,0

Barbeque Nation,I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past The only thing they handled well from the word go was the seating I booked a table for 14 from zomato It was ready for us when we arrived Everything else seemed to be falling apart their team was struggling to deliver The starters took forever to be served Most of them tasted similar though were called different things refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this some were duly replaced The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes When we held our ground he went back to personally create some dishes His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together ,3.0,1

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,This restaurant space in Gachibowi is the fusion of Urban Asia and Eat India Company which are under the same roof with different names Ambience This is very much spacious having multiple separated halls for group dining with cozy ambience This restaurant is themed with village style vintage wooden decors all around the place Most of the interior walls are covered with vintage wooden doors windows and locks And also there is a separate dining hall where one of the wall is completely covered with photo frames of old nizami Kings and their belongings Food We went here for a dinner buffet The food is really delicious and this was the first time I was liking Sea food in the starters All the starters are really good but Kung Pao fish and Prawns parsely dry are the best of its kind Dinner Buffer Menu Starters 1 Murgh Haryali Tikka 2 Lahsooni Murgh Tikka 3 Kung Pao Fish 4 Prawns Parsely dry 5 Crispy Potato Corn cube 6 Sichuan Baby Corn 7 Paneer Angar Tikka 8 Corn Tikka 9 French fries Main Course 1 Bindi Jai Puri 2 Yellow Dal Tadka 3 Palak Paneer 4 Murgh Lababdar 5 Mutton do Pyaza 6 Murgh Dum biryani 7 Sabzi Dum biryani 8 Garlic noodles 9 Butter Naan and Roti 10 Curd Rice 11 Khow suey Salads 1 Tossed Salad 2 Crispy Noodles Salad 3 Kimchi Salad 4 Grilled chicken salad Desserts 1 Pineapple Tarts 2 Chocolate Brownie 3 Pastries 4 Shahi Tukda 5 Varied flavors of ice creams We don t have much variety in desserts but the ice creams here are really good and served with different luscious toppings Just looking at them will trigger the cravings in your mouth Service The only saddest part of this restaurant is the service that they provide Though it is a buffet All the starters will served to the table There is a lot much interval from one starter to the other starter that they serve And you will feel that half the time your plate is empty and you need to keep on waiting for them to serve The service part of this restaurant is really irritating and this needs to be corrected with much importance Value for money The dinner buffet here costs around Rs 650 per person And you will definitely feel that this place is worth your money Be prepared to bear with the bad service and rest you will definitely enjoy Have a great dining and good day ,3.0,1

Dine O China,I was there today with three colleagues for lunch The ambience was okay and there were probably more waiters than customers We ordered the business lunch for two one chicken option and another sea food option Of the four appetizers we shared I loved the shrimp Fish was good I thought chicken was over cooked We shared two sea food dishes fried rice and noodles for main course They were all okay I asked if I could talk to the chef but was told he is too busy That was a first The waiters seemed friendly and were smiling with the women wearing a bright pink lipstick that matched well with their outfits Overall nothing special and keep your expectations right ,3.0,1
Frio Bistro,It was a funny experience there While the main course is quite satisfying the deserts were a total let down The ground floor could definitely do with some ventilation the fumes from the washroom will drive everyone away ,3.0,1

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,This was on my list since few months and finally we went for a Sunday buffet Ambience is good with cool music and performance Service ok Food not satisfied My review is only on vegetarian food Starters There were 5 veg starters 2 paneer crispy corn cheese poppers and mixed veg Crispy corn was disappointing and others were good Live counter Dosa was OK and Gobi paratha was good Main course I couldn t taste noodles as the dish was not refilled even after waiting for sometime All the gravy items were OK Deserts The dishes were Mysore Pak kaaja banana in hot jaggery liquid kaju burfi one type of laddu apple crunch answer kalakand Kaju burfi had more sugar and others were ok When I called to the restaurant they said that they will have approximately how 100 items but I couldn t find even 40 vegetarian items there I booked buffet in dineout offer So it was good deal for me In general I felt 1300 for buffet with this spread and taste is expensive ,3.0,1
Chinese Pavilion,Madhumathi Mahajan Well to start with nice courteous servers and staff Excellent serving time all items arrived on time infact for a change had folks asking if we want to hold a little while before getting next dish out These things matter a lot when u r paying to eat out Now food Jade chicken soup nice spinach based creamy stuff gud way to start the meal Accompanied by house salad of cabbage and cucumber kimchi nice dressing but cabbage cut could have been good Fish cakes were good loved it and accompanying sauces were awesome Main course was Mix XO rice of chicken and prawn well that was the downer Nothing exciting abt it maybe shld have coupled with a curry but then Nash fried rice u shld be able to enjoy dry Desert blue berry cheesecake so here is where me and wifey differ I thght it was worth it she says the base wasn t crunchy engh So try and rate yourself Last ambience was warm n eye soothing Oh and I forgot the orange pekoe tea the best I had in lat few months Have it,3.0,1

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,We went for the buffet lunch at Radisson after a few years The overall experience was very average There were events going on and the place was overcrowded Very few staff to help assist Coming to food some items on the buffet were decent The basics liike Paneer curry lacha paratha etc were good Salads and chaats were OK Desserts were below average The one thing that is usually safe is a pizza They had pasta and pizzas as part of the buffet Unfortunately they couldn t get the pizza to taste decent I had to leave pizza and eat something else which I never do Poor experience overall and unlikely to return again ,3.0,1

Gal Punjab Di,Been to this place a couple of times and enjoyed decent food But my last visit to this place disappointed me a bit Tried in starters sheela ka shashlik fish in starters Little more marination could have enhanced the flavour of dish Butter chicken which was ordered more didn t meet the taste buds The chicken seems to be not that fresh and tasted more like paneer The only dish which met our expectation was patiala Lassi This drags me to this place again n again Hope such things will be taken in near future ,3.0,1
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,First visit 1 Garlic Fried rice good 2 Mixed veggies in schezwan sauce good 3 Mixed mushroom platter did not please my taste buds Left half the dish I am not a fan of any mushroom other than the button mushroom Even if I liked other mushrooms I wouldn t have liked this dish It s nothing special Tasted like simple sauted mushrooms 4 Showstopper Yin Yan soup Half of it was a thick corn soup which has a subtle sweet taste The other half of it had thick coriander soup I think this is what they serve full bowl as lemon coriander soup Fan of this Coming back for this soup ,3.0,1
Karachi Cafe,The perfect place to spend a rainy afternoon with your loved one This retro Cafe will rewind you back to the 70s Ambience is the USP of this cozy little cafe Old classics playing in the background would soothe you with nostalgia We settled for an Irani Chai coupled with Mawa cake While the tea was top notch the cake was just about average Service is very good Overall one of those places where ambience can pull you again and again,3.0,1
Driven Cafe,I love this place Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me Spacious evergreen english songs eg Nirvana Bryan Adams on the back ground It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit talk sip coffee enjoy the background songs not a noisy cafe like some other cafes This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city But the negative point is that they don t have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items ,3.0,1
Tiki Shack,Visited this place on a Saturday evening cause I ve heard a lot about Tiki Shack The ambience was pretty decent and has a beautiful roof top view But I was honestly surprised that the food wasn t that great and infact I thought it was bad enough for all that I ve heard from people Ordered non veg nachos and I hardly found any non veg in it The pizza was quite bland too One of the really bad pepporoni pizza I ve had in my life Food 3 5 3 cause of service and the nice people there ,3.0,1
Ulavacharu,The place is really nice and gives a very strong telugu vibe Nice old songs to go with courteous service We ordered for Chicken fry pulav and sweet corn soup Sweet corn soup was ok The pulav was really good but really spicy which was expected Suggestion would be to order a boneless pulav instead Also we finished with a veg ulavacharu biryani The veg option was disappointing Should stick to non veg pulav biryani and boneless ,3.0,1
Marsala Food Company,We like to explore all places which serve good nonveg food and seeing the reviews on zomato decided to try this restaurant near dlf in gachibowli Overall experience was ok and nothing great They have a big dinning area We ordered marsala special chicken gravy and roti Which was with an omelette on top The taste wasn t something special and we could not get the proper flavour of this gravy Basa fish tikka was not as soft as we get it elsewhere Usually it melts in mouth and is super soft and tasty but we were disappointed here ,3.0,1

Frio Bistro,I wish I could give it a 3 5 but don t have the option Just for the record it deserves a strong 3 closer to a 4 We tried the Pizza Chicken Breast stuffed with spinach spaghetti followed by deserts The Turkish Pizza was the stand out dish for us we did not expect that The others were also very good and I would go again for sure The Tiramisu although looked and smelled great was the biggest let down The Bakhlava was just okay not a bad attempt The Cheese cake on the other hand was yumm Overall I would recommend this place with a word of caution that it is on the expensive side We ended up paying about a 1200 per head ,3.0,1
PourHouse7,We visited this place today A decent rooftop place with good ambience ipl screening okayish food and dj The service is a tad bit slow giving a resemblance of a place not visited often Though it was a weekend and strat of ipl season the place bore a deserted look Dj was good and adapted according to the crowd We started off with Butter garlic prawns and chicken popcorn Both of them turned out to be very oily We further ordered Fish tikka which was okayish Masala papad was in good quantity and tastier for a change They wer unable to manage a bunch of hooligan crowd who were throwing beer around unable to differentiate it with champagne If you are in a group and want a place not heavy on ur pocket can opt for PourHouse7 ,3.0,1

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Please don t visit this place as a part of official team lunch We sat in komatose but food buffet was from johnathans kitchen seating is comfortable for drinks but not for having food staff was busy serving alcohol as it churns more money we were ignored big time and were even charged 100 rupees for one kinley bottle air condition was switched off probably hence we were sweating profusely My first experience of komatose and johnathons kitchen was bad and would neither visit or recommend anyone for this place ,3.0,1

Absolute Sizzlers,I had ordered the smoked chicken pasta in red sauce I wouldn t say it was the worst but it was not up there There was no smokiness like the name claimed just bland chicken and rather a trail mix of vegetables that didn t really need to be there in it in the first place I would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no of vegetables maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out Also the smoked chicken needs to be upgraded The spaghetti was also slightly overcooked ,3.0,1

Eat India Company,This place has a good ambiance and is a treat for people wanting to take pictures but that s about it Went on a Sunday and there was no crowd at all The AC was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside The service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming Starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good the pace of refills needed to improve I honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course The stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that s about it It s expensive factoring in the food and service you get These guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment Could give it a try for the ambiance though ,3.0,1
Cafe Eclat,Situated at one of the prime locations clat was an average experience Ambience is good and service was decent guess they did not have many servers on that day The dessert we ordered was good but the chicken steak and burger were made of frozen chicken which was extremely chewy Beverages were decent Had heard a lot about the place but overall would rate it as just 3 ,3.0,1

Barbeque Nation,This was my first time at a Barbeque Nation I ve heard great things about it people sounded like they serve food from heaven Now let me tell you about my experience at this outlet not going to judge the other outlets The service was not good we had to call em more than thrice to get the starters served the chicken tasted stale fish and prawns were amazing though They were serving complimentary drinks I selected ice tea worst one I ve ever had The good thing about this place their manager he knew we weren t happy tried his best to make things right for us made the chef come to our table which felt good and cared for I liked the ambience of this place will definitely give another chance to this outlet ,3.0,1

The Chocolate Room,Sinful Nothing describes this place better Going through their super extensive menu would probably make you tired but the service is so appalling probably you ll die of hunger waiting for your order to arrive The place is cosy enough for you to carry a laptop and spend a couple hours on an assignment I d recommend you do that cause anyway they deliver orders after forever As the name goes I ve always had it in my mind to relate this place to a dessert bar And hence I ve never tried the savoury items offered here But I ve heard they have a good offering among sandwiches and nachos So that would keep my review limited only to the sweet dishes The Toblerone Shake and the Kitkat Shake are the shizzz So full of the taste actually well prepared The chocolate brownie is really a waste of money you ve probably had much better brownies all over Hyderabad Nutella Waffles and Death by Chocolate pancakes so good A heaven full of chocolate sauce and ice cream Make sure to hit the gym soon after P Slightly higher on the price point but worth a try ,3.0,1

AB's - Absolute Barbecues,Visited this place with my friends strong recommendation and great reviews seen To be honest it didn t live up to the great reviews and great reputation it has Food spread is huge and too many varieties are there so a big thumsup for the same Quality of food is not wow but very average prawn barbeque and chicken was very average Service is good and taken good care of Ambience was ok it was feeling hot and we were sweating inside All in all a average ok experience ,3.0,1

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,The staff is a little less knowledgeable and understanding when it comes to explaining the dishes they don t have anything for a vegetarian guest we had one vegetarian friend in a group of 10 who starved They restaurant smells for the raw meat from the kitchen The mocktails are good the pork is mid rare and juicy however the chicken is not that good ,3.0,1

Diners Pavilion,Went with family on Saturday Nov 3rd Only one more table was occupied so was worried about the place We were seated very quickly and food order taken quickly and served within reasonable time Food was okay not that great taste the chicken wings were good though Choice of non veg soups limited to 4 types and only 2 of them were available that time Chicken quesadillas didn t taste like a quesadilla It was like some chicken pieces wrapped in a roti There is nothing compelling to visit this place the second time ,3.0,1
Olive Garden,We ve been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since I am a big fan of starters So as soon as we reached the spot we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the Gachibowli area The interior was also tiny and seemed confined Anyhow we ordered chicken garlic chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant The staff were ok not quick but not rash though Even though they got our food very late they somehow tried to convince us with something non relatable situations Forgetting all that we just wanted to concentrate on our food As soon as we had our first bite the first thing that came to our mind was it s good but not great The flavour in the Biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices Overall it s a place where you can visit once in a while if you stay work near Gachibowli This is not a place to visit from a long distance Food 3 5 Service 3 5 Ambience 3 5 Value for money 2 5 5 Overall 3 5,3.0,1

Frio Bistro,I was at this bistro for dinner with my friends recently on a weekday Ambience was decent It was a tad too dark for my liking but the spacious table setting and the gentle hit tracks playing in the background made up for a nice dinner setting Service was pretty decent The waiter who attended our table was courteous and prompt in serving The food was a big disappointment though Of all the dishes we ordered few starters and the tiramisu cake were the only saving grace Main course Spinach ravioli Belly dance pizza Stuffed chicken breast and Greek chicken sovlakhi was a total disaster Not a single person from our group of 6 could find anything tasty from this bunch We finished the meal off with tiramisu and dbc cake which was good and filling Overall an average restaurant If you re looking for good Italian this is not the place to be CIBO house is ,3.0,1
Mathura Vilas,Disappointed with their so called special Navaratri thali festival they did not have any other option of thali during this time and when asked about north indian or south indian thali they told that they have only special Navaratri thali we decided to order two of them Nothing special in this one by Navaratri thali you would expect kadhi khichadi and some good options but this was actually a mix of north and south indian thali utappam sambar payasam kela sabji mixture from South and tandoor roti puri corn n peas sabji tikki from north and small mixed fruits salad green chutney sweet chutney plain curd they had just plain steam rice They missed serving us welcome drink of chaas lassi Overall disappointed for the price paid and options received ,3.0,1

10 Downing Street,A grand entry decent ambience and average food That just about sums it up for 10 Downing Street Just as the name suggests the place has a very British feel to it as far as the ambience goes It s cost warm and has great layout But the layout proves to be a negative as well We went here for lunch and the place was very loud The good point was that we got a great seat with excellent view The service was decent but one of the dishes we ordered did not arrive I hope they write down what was ordered The food itself was good We had chicken wings chicken Tikka seekh kabab tandoori veg platter and drinks The food was good and arrived a tad slow Overall it is a good place to have a drink and be merry ,3.0,1

Shanghai Chef 2,Nothing could be better than having restaurant owner recieving you at entrance and assuring you of best service The restuarant is located on first floor having sufficiently spacious area with decent interiors appropriately giving a glimpse of typical Chinese restaurant Not to mention the love of colour red and yellow which found prominence here too I hereby got convinced to rate ambience and decor 4 5 The crew was humble and the owner seemed delighted to have us After exchanging a few words he suggested us the best and quick food we could grab Owner and staff courtesy 5 5 We first ordered talumein soup 3 5 5 moderately spicy and filled with veggies which is certainly a healthy start We ordered mee gorang noodles 3 5 5 comprised of lots of green and red chillies a perfect form of noodles to relish Recommended to those who are tired of shewzwan noodles Noodles accompanied with 8 hot pot garlic gravy 3 5 which Went with noodles so well except the excessive quantity of French beans that hindered the potential of dish ,3.0,1

Gal Punjab Di,I visited this place with my friend It is there right in the heart of Gachibowli s Indiranagar vinayak nagar Upon entering you will definitely feel good and like a family restaurant which it is The ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off There are some corner sittings which many may or may not like and then there were chairs where fitting in was a bit tight Then comes the interaction with the staff They are quite friendly and hard working too They do have a quick serving time but thing is their attire was not up to the mark Menu had a wide variety of items and at some decent rates I really liked the way they split between veg and non veg food We ordered quite a lot of stuff but I really liked the dahi kebab It was good But with such good starter I had pinned my hopes on Patiala lassi But that was an anti climax of sorts They used essence for the lassi I hope they start making more authentic lassi with a malai on top That will surely be a game changer Overall it was a mixed experience and hence 3 5 ,3.0,1
Aromas@11SIX,If you have no value for money then this restaurant is good to waste your money Reason for giving 3 is due to veg curries which were told be good by my vegan friends But we non veg guys were totally disappointed for non veg curries It s got no taste at all Chilli chicken gravy was like saucy saucy No spicy at all Butter rotis were thicker than it usually has to be It tasted like wheat flour and not maida Service Good Taste Below average Ambiance Good Cost High,3.0,1

Prism Club & Kitchen,I have been on Friday night and reached at round 10pm It was almost full we hardly get space for standing They occupied huge space and designed interior amazingly which definitely deserve a cover charge as its into business but one thing which nowhere make sense to taking 500 bucks for just entry out of 2k when every items price also decent to take your business ahead We could not order any snacks except one as we had to carry on hand and could spoil our party mood I must say either they should revoke their concept of charging for entry or should be take responsibility to offer seats atleast when you are visiting as couple or in group Dj was playing good track and it was enjoyable moment we spent Zomato is showing 1200 for two ppl which is really surprising even though you cant step down to this place until unless spend 2k bucks so be aware and keep your pocket tight as this place is not for normal class people ,3.0,1

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,An evening in THE Radisson itself is one it s kind And when the food is unlimited it s just bliss a heaven on earth We had booked a table via Nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality variety of dishes and a great ambience But somehow we don t know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it It is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that we don t know When I retrospect back home I thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there Not that they were rude but they didn t care much The manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us Well coming to the dishes we had a nice sumptuous dinner The best part was the dessert section If had a variety of spreads It was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes Oh boy I had a ball Had the staff had been a little attentive I d have rated an easy 4 0 I guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the Nearbuy But we ve been too many 5 star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently Taste 3 5 Ambience 3 5 Staff 2 5 Value for money 3 5,3.0,1
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,I have visited Jonathan s kitchen on many occasions One thing that strikes me is for such a big restaurant their service is not so nice Also they denied us Zomato gold services saying we were sitting in Komatose however as per their front staff they told us to sit in Komatose as they didn t have seat in Jonathan s kitchen but the food menu and staff will all be from Jonathan s Hence we sat and ordered and later found out no gold accepted I have tried their buffet ala cart Sushi and everything else Nothing extraordinary The only benefit is it is close to my place ,3.0,1

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Sunday brunch experience at Cascade Radisson It was a mixed experience because they had things we loved but also things we hated I ll describe in the review Service was really good one of the best Mr Salim and staff really did a great job to host us Plus point for them Ambiance instead was a total let down at least for us Floor was dirty as you can see in some pics chairs were dirty even the water bottle was dirty The restaurant itself has nothing special no atmosphere just bland If you want to go and have a good time and to enjoy the atmosphere this is a NO NO Food was on the good side It had good spread and some really good items as fish in butter sauce or polenta with mushroom ragou Starters were average as desserts The best part on desserts was the fresh made waffles All other items are usually like everywhere salad counter pizza and pasta counter etc With some small exceptions has nothing special on menu but not bad on taste When it comes to the price for the buffet I think is too expensive Most of the times we go out with some kind of discounts or coupons but at full price definitely not worth it Food 3 5 Ambiance 2 5 Service 5 5 Value 3 5,3.0,1

Eat India Company,A group of 4 we decided to visit this place on Saturday evening The location is quite on the main road however the parking and the entry is terrible They can surely improve in this aspect as it can be a big turn off After entering the restaurant we were quite impressed with the ambience and the decor It had a very India taste to it They had old locks keys doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look Coming to the food there is a plethora of options on their menu Instead of going through it all we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer Hariyali Paneer Tikka and Corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination Corn cubes cannot be missed here My friend ordered a Chicken starter which was quite average though Moving to main course we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries Paneer Lababdar Mushroom curry and Nizami Handi seemed like good choices Food was decent The service was not impeccable It ca surely be improved Also they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal Quite a surprise The price point is a little on the higher side probably much more than average It can be a great negative They accepted gold on food so yay Overall a good experience but probably not one worth visiting again ,3.0,1

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,I came here for a buffet The overall experience was average They have a huge spread to choose from only in the salads and when it comes down to starters and main course i was pretty disappointed because of pretty limited options i had to choose from even from which there was just a single starter that made me even think about seconds The deserts were decent i loved the chocolate ice cream Moving on to ambience the seating and the restaurant was pretty decent and i think the true look and feel could be experienced at its best if you were to visit the place for a dinner The service was pretty swift Food 2 5 Ambience 4 5 Overall 3 5,3.0,1

10 Downing Street,A very mediocre experience to be honest at the outset I have been to the same restaurant in other cities and had great expectations The ambience is delightful and the three stars are only attributed to that It has a rooftop setting and a nice band was performing live Coming to food and service I would rate it 1 5 We tried the jalape o cheese poppers horrible taste so much so we had to leave some of it We had the vegetarian pizza served burnt at the base On asking for a replacement the waiter says it might take a while to prepare a new one Only the lasagne was slightly upto the mark The service was literally horrible being a Sunday everyone was just chilling on their own I guess I would recommend you to try out other places and save a large pocket pinch by avoiding this place ,3.0,1
Tiki Shack,Amazing indoor and outdoor place to chill Music is amazing go for safe choice of food selection which you are aware of I visit here all the time for music Cool crowd Gotta improve over food and cocktails Drinks otherwise is good options Two stars less coz they gotta improve over food ,3.0,1
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Great ambiance with very poor service Food 3 5 5 The starters were just OK main course was a little better For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case What disappointed most was the drinks even a classic margarita was not properly made It was orange is color and that is definitely not OK Ambiance 5 5 It definitely stands out for its ambiance Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants Service 2 5 This is where it is most disappointing you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city Price 3 5 It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved Overall would probably visit them again for the ambiance but with the hope that service improves ,3.0,1
Diners Pavilion,My second visit to this place Visited this restaurant once back in 2016 and was thoroughly disappointed This visit was better than the last one Was here for a team lunch with my colleagues we opted for the buffet The ambience of this place is decent There were some minor issues such as the table we sat on was uneven there was no salt and pepper on the table also there were no condiments Upon requesting the waiter served us Ketchup and Green chutney As we sat the waiters started serving the starters They included hara bhara kabab aloo tikki garlic paneer tandoori pineapple crispy corn and Chilly eggs Tandoori pineapple was a little different and in a good way relief from the barbecued pineapple dish that we often have at other restaurants Crispy corn hara bhara kabab and the tikki were also good The egg dish was average and garlic paneer was below average Veg Tom Yum soup was decent The main course was a bit disappointing Paneer Butter Masala tasted very bad and the rice dish with the tag name Kashmiri Pulao wasn t actually Kashmiri Pulao The two other Veg curries tasted average The desserts consisted only Vanilla ice cream Gulab Jamun and Moong dal halwa This was probably the most distasteful Moong dal halwa I ve ever eaten The service was prompt But this place didn t give me any reason to why I should visit again at least for a buffet The only way they re different is that they offer complimentary unlimited soft drinks But I think that is not good enough to keep customers coming back I ve visited places less than 1Km from this place who charge the same amount and yet have more variety of food If they can t increase the varieties they should start serving different new food compared to others because I m not visiting again if I can have similar food and better somewhere else Ambience 3 Service 3 5 Taste 3 Value for money 3 Overall 3 P S Apologies for the bad pictures,3.0,1
Eat India Company,Happened to visit this place for dinner on last Sunday The ambience is amazing with decor pieces from Rajasthan They have used various elements in a smart way We opted for a dinner buffet The variety of items in the buffet were good But starters were served cold on the table This place is decently priced I personally loved the Thai soup chicken kabab butter naan and dal Food 3 5 5 Ambience 4 5 Service 4 5,3.0,1

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,We went for a family dinner on 15th April Being a 5 star restaurant some basic amenities were missing which you can easily get in any local drive in or a dhaba Noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 7 8 min whereas in any other 5 star a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry However we went inside and opted for a buffet The food spread was very good however few of them were cold roast chkn and fish tikka The fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert The most annoying thing was the on the table service The table wasnt ready when we were seated We had to ask for napkin spoon fork and even for a glass of water Multiple times The empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean The taste of the food was good though and thats the only reason for me giving a 3 star ,3.0,1

Club Rogue,The ambience was decent but we went for a ladies night and it was a tad bit crowded understandable The music was good the only downside to the whole thing was that the person giving out drinks at the counter was downright ignoring us We actually became a little uncomfortable after that because we were right in front of him waving hands not drunk at all because we were asking for out first drink of the night and he was handing out drinks to everyone else except us Looks like he had something againts us ,3.0,1
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Visited with family for dinner on a special occasion The valet parking was a relief Unfortunately there was no maitre d and we had to seat ourselves The ambience was great I loved the light colours and bright lighting as it put a positive spin on the evening The food was really good The sushi even the veg variant was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb Service however was lacking on all parameters It was cold and inefficient It was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out couple of women in particular could not catch their names The billing too took an unreasonable amount of time The food here is great but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to 3 Quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant Will we return Perhaps not in the near future the only reason we would return at some point would be Zomato Gold on the food ,3.0,1

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sardarji s chaats and more is synonymous with the typical street food in Delhi and is nostalgia served in a plate all over for people who have for any point of time savored on the street food in delhi The sandwiches especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome The dahi bhalla dahi papdi s are good too However off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food Another complaint i had with them are their parathas they are bad polar opposite to their chaat dishes I would never recommend anyone ordering paratha s from this place and I tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked This is the reason I have rated them as 3 out 5 ,3.0,1
Eat India Company,It was supposed to be a really casual lunch and we didn t expect this place to be nice but were surprised for sure So it s a nice restaurant with well arranged furniture and light Has a buffet lunch which is very convenient for Software professionals and casual lunches with friends I have small complaints which are listed in the end but apart from that I had a nice time So in the spread something that I loved dearly was the Chilly Prawns I just couldn t get enough of it It was amazing The chicken was alright But I can say but prawns were the best Although they were really small but can t complain much They didn t give us fish even after we asked for it Staff attentive and service was okay Ambience very nice place looks good clean effort was put in to make it look nice Food food was definitely good I liked it quite a lot apart from the desserts They were pretty bad Complaints Starting with the ice cream guy they have a cold stone ice cream He broke a water glass on the bar counter while making ice cream technically just mixing it and he used his already worn gloves and ice cream scoop to push the glass pieces away Didn t wash his hands or change his gloves or wash his scoop For all we know the glass pieces were still on his hands and scoop Second is also with the ice cream guy we found hair inside the ice cream he made us and returned it immediately Lost our appetite soon after that Third is with one of the waiters probably didn t want to give us fish even after we asked him to get us some which was on the buffet menu He agreed to get some but never showed up with it I hope it s his memory and nothing else that caused the problem Hopefully management reads this and takes action on it If those factors are avoided then will go again definitely ,3.0,1
Pot Pourri,I went there last Sunday Had a buffet Honestly I didn t like the food taste and quality of vegetable and specially non veg items It tasted stale No doubt service is good staff is always smiling But they need to improve a lot on food quality Even the biryani was not up to the mark Moreover the chicken was undercooked or old our stomach felt funny when we reached home ,3.0,1
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Food 4 Service 3 The food is nice but the fancy dishes fail to impress Had ordered Lotus leaf fried rice but that neither had any distinguishing flavor of lotus leaf nor a hint of chili oil but what lets you down is the service Too SLOW And they also goofed up on the Zomato 1 1 food offer They later corrected it but not before arguing Will I go here again YES but not the Gachibowli joint The other Urban Asia at Jubilee hills is a way better ,3.0,1

The Old Madras Baking Company,The Old Madras has been our go to place for some nice coffee with a sandwich whenever the weather is nice and you want to enjoy it sitting outdoor The coffee is quite good with a lot of variations available The best part is the freshly baked breads Those beautiful soft breads make the sandwiches all the more tasty when grilled with butter Even the puffs and Victoria cake are nice to have Coming to the worst part the service In all my visits over the past couple of months this has been the biggest turn off about this place Almost always I had to go to the counter to place the order instead of a waiter coming over Second would be the cleanliness of the outdoor seating More often than not you can see flies buzzing over the tables Though the kitchen looks quite hygienic ,3.0,1

Dunkin' Donuts,I just came out of this outlet The food is as per DD standards but the venue lacked basic hygiene and maintenance The tables were not cleaned on time and hence it had flies hovering around it The wipe used for cleaning the table too was so dirty that it left a stench behind after the table was cleanes For payment too when I decided to pay through the mobile wallet instead of the standard QR code or getting a request for the OTP I was asked to pay the same to the store managers number as their system wasn t working ,3.0,1

The Tilt Bar Republic,Just make sure why you are going there If food it would be a 3 rating yes comparatively cheaper buffet in near by restaurants though and if it drinks it would hang near 4 Their varieties in drinks get that for them Place is good in ambiance but total inside so not a roof top or garden You can enjoy the game days well than other days And yes a good value for your money,3.0,1

Barbeque Nation,To start with the complimentary drinks Blue mojito pacific blue fresh lime soda were refreshing The nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken prawns or fish Head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day The veg starters Mushroom is a immediate No cripsy corn was not salted properly paneer came as a saviour Maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer Coming to Desserts Its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled Browine was too dry cakes were not tasty apple pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup phirni an absolute no kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it Overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section I can only rate it 3 for food 5 for service 3 for ambience as its too crowded going neck to neck in every counter ,3.0,1

Cafe Eclat,The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool But we were in for huge disappointments They have too vast a menu for them to handle Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago We ordered their self recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken This at a cost of Rs 280 was completely unreasonable for me The chicken and mushroom soup was good but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago Coffee was ok pretty much standard as everywhere else All in all hugely disappointed with the promises of FRESH and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing ,3.0,1

Chinese Pavilion,Hello This place was bookmarked for a long time now so I wanted to pay it a visit And finally the moment came when I was actually able to go there I am a huge fan of Indo Chinese cuisine and I honestly had a high hope from this place but all in all it was disappointment I ordered chicken manchow soup which was good although the salt was on the higher side Hakka noodles and fried rice has too much oil and there s no reason for that amount of oil to be there in the Chinese food Wolly chicken and chicken chilli dry had extreme amount of garlic which weren t properly fried and rather than giving a good taste it made the entire dish difficult to eat as the flavour was overpowering All in all the food wasn t enjoyable Will I visit again Probably not I am sorry Thanks ,3.0,1

Eat India Company,Being a foodie and going for a buffet is like craving for a lump sum treat But the restaurant has disappointed 1 Ambience and service was great 2 We went for buffet firstly the starters weren t that good at taste Common panner kebab type of starter corn chicken veg kebab Well none o them weren t good as having them twice 3 Main course was a disaster very few choices that too of rare vegetables and less eaten No panner the main dish rice items weren t good Skipped and went to the desert section 4 Desserts was like stabbing a dead man Nothing exciting only the ice cream was good Overall it is expensive and less satisfying If you are hungry and looking for a buffet please skip this one ,3.0,1
Biryanis And More,Ambience Normal proper dinning with lcd TV playing songs or cricket Food As the name says wide varieties of biryanis are there If u are an authentic Hyderabadi dum biryani fan then better try other biryanis items except dum category Kaju kheema rice biryani goes good Service 15min on an avg,3.0,1
Asian Meal Box,This place has never disappointed me a go to restaurant at any time When you want to give some standard benchmark for a Egg fried rice or its combo with any starter this place will be on top of my mind Only negative is they have options for spicy curdy and which they will consider before cooking Can improve on this ,3.0,1

Over The Moon Brew Company,This place was on my Hyderabad bucket list for a long time The ambience was awesome to top that it was IPL 2019 final The live dj was great Coming to the food we ordered a pitcher of Belgian brewed warning it s a jug rather than a pitcher but that s the best beer I ever had The beer was accompanied by chicken 65 and pepperoni and lamb pizza Both of them were outstanding The worst part was the service the place is short on staff One waiter was waiting 7 tables and he constantly kept on ignoring us as we were the last table ,3.0,1

Olive Garden,It was my 4th order with Olive Garden in the last 6 months I loved the food from this place and this is the reason I ended up ordering from here multiple times This time it was a total disappointment in terms of the Veg Food and the service that was provided There was no difference in terms of taste and appearance for Veg Dum Biryani Veg Pulao Both of these dishes were same I don t know how the restaurant makes that difference still wondering In terms of the service I ordered the food from Zomato at 8 00PM and the time of delivery was shown as 8 55PM I ordered it keeping in mind my meeting timing however the restaurant was able to provide food to the delivery guy only at 9 30 which is like 35 mins late from the slated time I would still want to rate the food a 4 even after my bad exp with Biryani Pualo Service wise I would rate this place a 2 5 The manager executive from the restaurant to whom I spoke over the phone just kept saying one thing that sir we are working on your order and it will take 10 mins ,3.0,1
Ulavacharu,Food and ambiance are great here but cost of the food is high with respect to quantity Service was too slow and can t able to manage things We ordered Raju gari kodi pulao chicken majestic and ulvacharu kodi pulao names are self explanatory and village names which makes the taste buds high to taste Overall review Raju gari kodi pulao is spicy and must taste food if you like some liquidity in pulao ,3.0,1

Hyper Local,The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too The ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up The utilisation of the limited space is done well A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set Moving on to the food we tried the newly launched Drudge menu Priced at Rs 1200 this was an expensive affair However if you are early I e before 4 30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for 799 They had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food The drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler The buffet Consisted of golgappe Dahi bhalle Sev puri bruschetta mini veg and non veg pizza Dahi kachori chole bhature red Thai curry with rice chicken tikka fries noodles and chicken tikka pockets Golgappe Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste Dahi kachori was a complete let down The bruschetta stood out and pizza was average Chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren t crisp The red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation Noodles were randomly kept with no gravy The chicken tikka pockets were dry The chicken tikka was good and marinated very well Overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn t go together The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn t sound correct The music was extremely loud for the place Overall we had a below average Experience Based on the drunch menu I would rate it 2 5 5,3.0,1

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,This place is good unless you look at the menu card It s like drinking alcohol and having good food and finding out you paid extra which you could have saved if you would have gone to a similar place with much less to spend 900 rs for a glass of wine Well not worth going twice specially if other places are serving the same wine for 400 a glass But if you re a first timer the you must visit just to remind yourself there are other places much more cheap than this DJ plays some really nice music And one advantage is that this place is opened till 2 am ,3.0,1
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Was waiting for longtime to be Zega with the rating it possesed B B Zega Mojito Herbal Delight Oriental Fantasy Blushing Dragon were ok but not that great Chilli chicken fish paneer were also of subtle taste The lamb starter should have been more soft in eatable consistency Egg and chicken friedrice was not having any salt Veg Thai Curry was ok to some extent Diff types of chicken noodles were ordered which was of average taste Schezwan veg fried rice was below average Somehow not satisfied with the quality of food served or the flavours or the service Disappointing for the price paid and the food we had ,3.0,1

Komatose - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,These stars are just for the food and drinks I just don t like the service and attitude of the staff or rather just our luck that we encountered the same person twice Almost threw the order on the table when prepared Even the food he served was without any accompaniments that were supposed to be there Drinks are good food is ok zero stars for the service ,3.0,1
Mustang Terrace Lounge,With an impressive location it could have been one of the prime spots but the placement of items seems unimaginative The ambiance created with the light bulbs is utterly ruined with a large screen in the middle of the room The sound system needs improvement with focus on more than just base The food is good and it was worth the wait in this decrepit atmosphere The outdoor seats are not as comfortable and there is no measure to tackle scenarios of rain It is a decent place to just have food but expect nothing more,3.0,1
Al Saba Restaurant,Have been to this restaurant many times Taste wise preferably better than all other restaurants next to Shah Ghouse I would say Quantity wise one biriyani will be more than enough Chicken Biriyani with double masala would be a treat to taste buds Go for it The chicken would be damn soft and good Starters like Pepper Chicken Chicken Tikka Tandoori all are good They need to work more on ambiance as the place is not clean Moderate pricing and enough number of items to go with ,3.0,1

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,It was a night out with gal pals When we entered the server took us to our sitting area we chose a corner as it had a couch felt it was bit secluded Warm indoors black and brown seatings cartoons of laal street their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the TV They have their own app for ordering but guess what their wifi wasn t available as it was under repair That is what server told us The server came and took our orders We ordered starters and drinks As soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere It kind of scared us then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation Then we started enjoying the music and our orders came The server got one of the drinks wrong we reminded him it was changed he said he already brought this Other places the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast Instead he said he cant take it back Anyways moving on The cocktail which i had were really good The cosmopolitan Beer trap and Screw driver The starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian Italian cheese fingers They were crispy and yum Stuffed mushrooms they were okay and forgettable the Nachos were okay have had better ones The crispy corn was good Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters The music was good Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it first they said at 9 30 they will start then said 10 30 it will start We four were only on the dance floor we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song He didnt oblige at all Would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills God knows Food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar Hope they improve their hospitality That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again Food 3 5 Service 3 5 Overall experience 4 5 Because of friends VFM 3 5 5,3.0,1

T Grill,On the way back home from Mrugavani National Park had a stop here for lunch I really felt the present state of this place like lot of things gone missing First impression no one at the parking to guide or coordinate it all were parked zigzag welcomed by foul odour at that point Huge place but no one seem to let us know of how to proceed further like where to sit or dine especially if it was first time like me Initially noticed an outdoor seating organized perfectly under hut shape units spread across the whole area with vibrant chairs and tables Felt like scorching sun breeze wouldn t make us withstand it for quite long and so thought not an good idea to have lunch outdoors also felt kitchen exhaust smoke widespread No one cared to guide until I personally asked of any indoor is available So shifted to inside dining room great relief finding at a corner a place for us Our order was Veg platter not worth price taste quantity Jumbo chicken Biryani evenly cooked tender chicken not so flavorful Mutton Biryani is good Service lag may be of huge rush Missing fine dine features asked for finger bowl but got an answer to wash hands outside Village back drop artifact greenery are little bit saviors May be at evening hours outdoor seating could be good choice Anyway no thrill at T grill ,3.0,1

Pista House,Heard a lot about the place and had clean and nice food delivered at home So I finally decided to pay a visit to the place myself High Expectations The place was nowhere near what I had imagined The restaurant wasn t a very neat and hygienic place the plates were dirty and the cutlery and sauce storage boxes tainted and dirty The people there were not welcoming too and their uniforms were half tucked in Moving on to the good part the food was cleaner than most non veg places in Hyderabad with the Chicken having a little less oil than most places The desserts looked sumptuous even though I was full for them I manged to take some pictures of them So from now on I am just going to get myself a delivery from that place rather than actually going there and if I go there it would be for the sole purpose of trying out the desserts ,3.0,1

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area we have other choices Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there 1 Crabmeat Soup This soup was thick with minced crab meat The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce vineager and crushed pepper The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds 2 Corn Cubes A must try out platter The dish was innovative The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency 3 Chicken Yakitori I did not like this preparation It was very dull and tasteless There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor Main Course 1 Manchow Chicken Fried Rice The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own Dessert 1 Bangkok Custurd I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts It tasted like Firni As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls It was just yum for the greedy tongue Total Rs 1396 Inclusive of taxes Cobclusion The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card No coordination among the staffs Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions Its just okayish for casual dinner lunch I will think twice to visit this place again ,3.0,1

Behrouz Biryani,Ordered the much hyped about Behrouz biriyani today Wanted to have it since ages So today when the package came I was really thrilled The biriyani comes in a stunning package And as you open it the room fills with amazing Biriyani smells The biriyani was looks good with a lot of almonds and greens as garnishing on top The biriyani comes with raita and a gulab jamun too The biriyani is quite different from the other popular biriyani in Hyderabad This one is extremely sutle in taste The chicken was tender and was breaking apart easily The rice grains were staying apart and was expertly cooked Overall the biriyani was a really good experience But I personally prefer the spicy type when it comes to Biriyani but this biriyani is different and it is mouth wateringly delicious in a completely different way ,3.0,1
Hyderabadi Daawat,Looking at the overall rating the close promixity to our office visited this place for lunch along with my team today Looks like this place is mainly for IT people as most of it is occupied by 3 batches 12 Nothing great to say about the interiors ambiance it is decent enough I am the odd man out in the group being the only vegetarian but will put in words what my colleagues said about the non veg food Veg Not that great we ordered Panneer tikka palak sheek kebab for starters Sabzi Nawabi Handi butter naan for mains Panneer is rubbery not soft indicating it is not fresh Palak sheek kebab is kind of bland with no taste not cooked properly As suggested by the staff we opted for Sabzi Nawabi Handi which is a bad decision as the taste is not that good Service wise they took lot of time in getting our order which is a let down as well Non veg Sikendari Raan is a standout dish whereas the other Murg Musallam is bland with no taste spiceness to it Same is the case with Yakhni Shorba which tasted like hot gravy water Overall I would not suggest anyone to visit this place considering the inconsistency in the food they served along with bad service ,3.0,1

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,This seemed to me as mainly buffet focussed breakfast lunch and dinner staying guests being the main clientele I ve had a few meals here and couldn t complain Standard fare with many options laid out which probably won t wow you but you ll find a few things that you ll like Their service is really good and I find the ambience very relaxed The a la carte section is quite limited and basic but they do make a pretty mean grilled fish dish ,3.0,1
eat.fit,For the first time tried the light lunch meal from Eat fit which has 450Kcal as mentioned Decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box Chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil Chapatis were homely soft and warm something a bit hard to get in Hyderabad A less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier Not sure if I would order this again but could maybe try their salads ,3.0,1
Gal Punjab Di, Nai They don t have any punjabi Gal First things first really not happy with their service Two different groups of people who came after us were served earlier than us and another worst thing was Washrooms din have water supply and that created a big problem for most of the customers So finally we got our order after 20 25 min of wait The lemon coriander soup was quite normal with dense eggy smell In starters Amrutsari murg was nice with moderate flavours along with malai This came with grated cheese on top of it which was the only best part Methi roti was fresh and good which came with 2 pieces Unlike plain tandoori tasted too bad it was the flour which got stale over the time may be Don t know how they served it So we ordered Boneless Murg i guess it was Murg Musalam this tastes really good just like as i needed less spicy thick gravy and nice pieces of chicken Overall one time try stop ,3.0,1

NorFest - The Dhaba,The place is located in the food court of SLN Terminus and the first branch of Norfest in the city The seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole As it was winter we were fortunate to have Makki ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag The Makki ki Roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan Saag was good but lacked salt in it The flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it The next thing was Amritsari Kulcha and Chole a must try and must have at Norfest The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good The final dish was the Paneer Lababdaar and Garlic Naan the curry again lacked salt and was not upto the mark in terms of taste So overall not recommended VFM 4 5 Taste 3 5,3.0,1

Frio Bistro,The place has a nice quiet ambience I was surprised that it wasn t crowded as you d expect a top place to be on a weekend We were ushered in well and we choose a nice cozy place the place had a nice charm to it We ordered the Tangy Grilled Mushrooms and the Glazed Pork Ribs but the disappointing aspect of our visit though was we were rushed into placing the order We came in at 10pm and we were told to place our last orders instantly when I checked they said the place shuts down at 11pm and the last order was at 10 15pm Coming to food the mushrooms seemed a bit too tangy but that s probably my palate the glazed pork ribs were top notch and juicy and tender Had it not been for the pushy waiters we would have liked to order drinks and a dessert too The waiters made sure that they cleared the plates in a jiffy and pounced on us with our last spoon handing us the copy of the bill and all of this before we even touched 11pm Not that our intentions were to have a night out there but you don t actually liked to be rushed on your orders and food it just doesn t leave a good experience Possibly the restaurant and it s employees were planning on catching a flight and made sure nothing came in the way The rating is for the food and the place in general Service is a bare minimum ,3.0,1
Pot Pourri,The staff here is confused First person tells us that paneer items won t be available and that it will take a minimum of 25 mins for any other thing we order and the other person assures us to get everything in 5 10 mins including paneer items But the food tasted pretty good We ordered few rotis with veg kofta curry And Chilly garlic fried rice The ambience is pretty simple it s one large seating area with different tables Food 4 5 Ambience 3 5 5 Staff 3 5,3.0,1

13 Dhaba,The overall taste is good and I recommend Paneer Thali which is both reasonable and yummy But if you order paranthas then the North Indian taste that a parantha has is little missing Overall combos are good and Thali s too are nice option to go for ,3.0,1
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,This restaurant has its priorities straight Unlike AB s Flechazo and Barbeque Nation that swing for the fences and end up failing many times this place has hit a sweet balance between Hospitality and Taste Which means you have none of the irritating fake friendly over eager monkeys from the above mentioned places pushing and prodding you to try weird stuff even if you don t want to Instead you get a homely little corner where you can sit quietly and be left alone to mind your business until you order for something Very professional indeed The starters are awesome here they actually set the tone for the things to come This place features a wide range of delectable options for vegetarian diners as well which is a big step up from its competitors Kebabs are to die for Having said that the main meal was nothing to write home about They have tried a lot of things from Mughlai Intercontinental to Chinese but somehow these dishes don t come together on the plate But what actually took my heart away what this joint EXCELS in hands down compared to ANY FREAKING RESTAURANT IN THE CITY is the Desserts department For someone who loves sweets it s a psychedelic experience The variety and taste will haunt you for days The desserts are neither too sweet nor too rich Just the type that the northern crowd will go berserk about I was thoroughly satisfied and if you leave out the clove heavy gravy of mutton and the generic dishes of the main menu then the place is a RockaRolla discovery Definitely worth one visit and then the count will just keep on ticking ,3.0,1
Hunger Maggi Point,I ordered an veg corn Maggie which was okay to eat But the fried maggie s are much more tempting and more tasty The only drawback on visiting the shop is that they only accept the cash ,3.0,1
