Khaan Saab,It was a Thursday night that we decide to go to this Khaan Saab and get the feeling of being a Royal Guest The ambience inside and the interiors were definitely apt to their punch line it gives you the Royal Feeling We ordered main course only as we were way too hungry Butter Naan Punjabi Kulcha Chicken Kurchan Chicken Khandar First of all I felt the pricing was a bit expensive but for the ambience and the royalty of the place I would buy it if the food is also that good The Butter Naan had loads of Butter to our delight and were very soft and worth it The Kulcha had potato filling but we expected it to be a bit more surprising given it was Punjabi Kulcha Both the side dish had shredded chicken in gravy We were 7 people so while ordering when we ordered only two sides the waiter told us that one side dish suffices for only 2 or at max 3 people Given the price 380 we were amazed to hear this However we ordered only 2 and when the food arrived we understood why the waiter said so in the first place So we ordered one side dish later on and enjoyed the food The taste and the quality was really excellent for all the money However there was another thing which stopped me from giving a 5 star rating to the place We asked for the bill and everything in it was justified except the charge for water We had ordered regular water so theu gave 3 500ml Aquafina bottles and later on they gave a 1 litre bottle And they charged 150 for that in the bill quite ironical when the MRP is 10 for these bottles They charge GST and they charge water at such a idiotic price We clicked many pictures near the giant Elephant near the entrance The whole place was very well decorated and I could easily spend one hour just clicking pictures ,4.0,2

Biryanis And More,I cant fully comment or give a full 5 star rating but I would definitely start with a 4 star as the kebabs I ordered were simply one of the best I have ever had I ordered Chicken Malai kebab and Chicken Hara Mirchi kebab Both the kebabs were juicy and succulent with individual distinct flavors in each of them I really like it when one kebab doesnt taste like the other and each has its own unique flavor While the homeminister like the less spicy and creamy flavor of the chicken malai kebab I preferred the tangyness of the hara mirchi kebab Although a bit on the pricier side given the flavors and the taste I am definitely waiting for a chance to order their biryani because if the kebabs are to go by anything the biryani would definitely be flavorsome Food 5 5 Value for Money 4 5,4.0,2
Frio Bistro,This place is my go to place for continental food at Gachibowli The food is absolutely awesome My recommendations would be Doner kebab any variant of their thin crust pizza and pork ribs The doner kebabs are filled with juicy lamb meat balls and topped with spicy mayo stuffed inside fluffly pita breads with a sude of humus In pizza I love the pigs over a blanket pizza The pizza crust is super thin and this place serves one of the best wood fire pizzas here In mains the pork ribs just melts in your mouth and the stuffed chicken breast is deliciously with the filling of creamy spinach inside In desserts I loved all their creations from the baklava to cherry chocolate cheese cake and to the old fashioned tiramisu The service is quick and the staff is courteous ,5.0,2
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Went for a Sunday bruch and compared to other places of the same league the staff is definitely the most friendliest but the food options are the bottom most on my list The food is good definitely but for a Sunday brunch the options are extremely limited compared to what s being offered around I am thankful to the staff for pulling together a cheese platter just to accompany my wine and for that I took them to 4 from my initial 3 Sometimes the smiles and the courtesy make a lot of difference and might want me to visit again The beverage alcohol menu is very limited does not match back to others I hope they match it up We had to separately order drinks as there was nothing on their selection that we drank And before I forget their dessert bar is good ,4.0,2
Udipi's Upahar,When I first reached Hyderabad I wanted to eat dosa and idli Just like the ones I had in Chennai So after some research I reached Udupi s upahar The sambar was sweeter than I expected I believe it is the Karnataka style I still liked it The Bonda was awesome and the price was comparatively low Great experience I would like it if they had spicier sambar ,4.0,2

eat.fit,I wanted to make my adjustments in my food habits and was looking for genuine healthy options around Gachibowli I did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eat fit was my saviour This was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in India Few reasons why eat fit is better than other places 1 They do not use any processed ingredients 2 They do daily sourcing of veggies meats That s the real secret for the consistent taste 3 They use less amount of oil compared to any other joint in the market 4 NO Maida No Sugar what so ever in any of their dishes 5 Daily Cooking They cook a limited number of portions and there are various other reasons as well The calorie count does help me keep my weight in check and the best part is all the Indian meals are very tasty especially their No cream Dal Makhni Nilgiri Chicken Hyderabadi Chicken Mangalorean Chicken Kashmiri Chicken Tawa Subzi Paneer gravy in Chefs special veg thali to mention a few Not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day The healthy desserts smoothies and snacks like chicken tacos Wheat Chicken Momos Chicken Baida Roti are filling These help me get rid of my crazy hunger pangs in the evening The only downside for me is that it s a Zomato Exclusive and Zomato is pathetic in the market when it comes to food delivery They promise to deliver the food any time between 30 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour By the time food arrives it s already cold which I hate personally This happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location The algorithm being used by Zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless Zomato needs to check this and also eat fit management also should take some actions against Zomato They have prepared nice and tasty food but due to their dependency on Zomato Exclusivity many customers are disappointed Verdict Taste 4 5 5 Packaging 4 5 VFM 4 5 5 Overall 4 5 5 Zomato Delivery 1 5,4.0,2
Cafe Eclat,The place is near the Gachibowli flyover The ambience and decor is brilliant I had Tiramisu here it was good Though I expected espresso flavour but the taste of mocha was strong in tiramisu You can make your own gelato in a jar here Sitting arrangement is good and staff courtesy is fine I went there on a Wednesday evening and cafe was empty Crowd must come on weekends I believe Prices are on the higher side but then again it s one of the best dessert shop in the area ,4.0,2

Cafe Eclat,As a compulsive dessert and bread hogger I was logically drawn towards the menu of this place And it didn t disappoint If you are looking for a doughnut please move away from those factory line produced dense overtly sweet and miserly filled ones It s about time they dunk themselves in a pot of acid Eclat s doughnuts are exactly what the deep fried yet fluffy bites of joy should be The Berliners are generously filled and are light enough not to stick to your teeth The New York Cheesecake is one of the best I ve had in terms of texture It s rich and flaky when the fork hits it and absolutely melts as soon as it touches your tongue I do recommend cutting back on the cinnamon a tad bit to ensure it allows the flavours of the cheese to shine through The chocolate cake is decadent and comfortably ranks one among the best in the city The key lime tart is full of flavour with the right balance of tang and sweet The taste of the dishes confirms the use of good quality ingredients and an understanding of the technic needed to churn out great products Keep it up ,4.0,2

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Reach out to thehedonisticbhukkad on Instagram for more Visited this place for a rather late lunch say somewhere around 3 4 Ambience Simply classic and sufficiently spacious at least we felt so because we were the only customers in the restaurant This place reeks of class elegance from the moment you step inside the elevator The place is brightly lit and relaxing Though the rooftop view is breathtaking coupled with sitting by the poolside we preferred sitting indoors Service Gopal was our server for the day Courteous and meticulous he helped us with suggestions for dishes more suitable for our tastes The staff overall seemed to be attentive and polite Food We ordered two drinks I can t recollect the names sorry for that and they arrived promptly at our table within no time Ordered Caprese Bruschetta and Creamy Pesto Penne Pasta I ve tried Bruschetta at other places but never savoured it the way I did here The freshness of toppings was evident The pasta was sufficient for two and that again was a delight to eat Had to rush hence couldn t try the desserts Overall dining at Mazzo is an indulgence The prices might seem steep for some but for the experience it provides it is definitely worth a visit ,5.0,2

The Glass Onion,The Glass Onion is located at a calm and a quiet place Despite being around a km behind Infosys the place gives it an advantage of switching away from city chaos and you needn t be bothered about finding a place for parking While the restaurant does offer valet but the parking area next to the restaurant is huge and you can easily get a place there Once you enter the restaurant you re floored by the grandness of the place as it comes as something unexpected They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements Owing to the summers we opted for indoor seating The tables are well spaced and there s enough distance between the adjacent tables to give you a premium experience The servers are well groomed attentive and make good recommendations basis the specialities of the restaurant and after checking your preference For starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti Kebab and Nachos The Kebabs were well cooked and though a little spicy left a good after taste The Nachos were light crispy and had good amount of toppings Despite Nachos being one of the common starters I d still recommend people to try the ones here For the main course we ordered the Lahori Paneer Combo that gets served with a small bowl of Dal Makhni and Naan Pulao The Paneer too tasted very good and had the right amount of spices which blended well with the Paneer The Dal Makhni that came along with the Paneer was out of this world It s a pity that it doesn t get served separately but upon request the servers certainly obliged by offering another small bowl of the same For something that s prepared so well I feel that the patrons should get to taste more of it and would request the management of the restaurant to include it in their menu Finally the dessert Tiramisu pastry Simply no words Right amount of sweetness well blended flavour and that smooth after taste of coffee After a good dinner the Tiramisu sealed the deal for us to be one completely satisfied customers One small observation that I d still like to add is that despite a good number of servers they tend to get distracted and slightly inefficient when all the tables start getting full Towards the end we had to remind them about the dessert and it was evident that they had missed bringing it However considering that they were attentive and friendly for most of our time there I wouldn t penalize the restaurant with a star but would request to keep a check on the observation and continue to maintain the quality of the food to keep ensuring repeat visits ,5.0,2

The Fisherman's Wharf,Special occasions call for unique celebrations accompanied by some fantastic fare Dinner last night at Fisherman s Wharf was one such memorable experience Spread across an acre with multiple dining sections carved around the garden courtyard it transports you to the coast We choose to sit in one of the Mangalore tiled pavilions with mist fans and earthy furniture Now coming to the food started with the masala fried prawns marinated in toddy vinegar Accompanied by these soft paos the prawns with a hint of tanginess were one of the best I have had in recent times Chicken xacuti with boneless chicken pieces wrapped in a robust spices was scrumptious and went very well with both the tandoori roti and the pao Goan style coconut base fish curry which came along with rice was enjoyable but not exemplar Sweet ending with the classic bebinca along with vanilla ice cream to complete the meal The setting food and moreover the gracious service made it a top notch experience for us After redemption of the Zomato Gold offering we paid 1474 for three adults and one child,5.0,2

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,There are two restaurants and they are Collage a multi cuisine restaurant and Deori authentic India cuisine restaurant I always have my breakfast and dinner at Collage except the first day at this hotel Many service staffs take order and serve foods All of them are thorough in the mindset of serving customers Especially among these staffs Parmeshwar and Lalmalsawmi have very good sense of service and are outstanding to understand what customers really want From the moment of entry to the Collage to the exit they really care about my moving path within the restaurant In case of Parmeshwar he always greets me with smiley face and guides me to my table He always asks my feeling of the day and recommends the food as per my mood He is always getting me things I ask for and never forgets brings me things whereas others sometimes forgets as they are always busy and be asked by other customers for things on their way to get something I ask for He has very good knowledge and insights of the industry and field in which he work and talk with me the way it needs to be improved for better service As for Lalmalsawmi she always keeps an eye on me She brings me chopsticks or Kimchi depending on the food I order even though I do not ask She knows how many ice cubes I like in a glass depending on the types of beverages I drink She never forgets to have water bottles frozen in a freezer a day before I play golf because I drink a lot of water while I play golf under the smoking hot weather This is something I even forget myself and that is why I really want to thank her Generally the grade of service from this restaurant is excellent but as I mentioned above I specially want to convey a lively sense of gratitude from the bottom of my heart ,5.0,2
The Glass Onion,Talk about a perfect date night and The Glass Onion is the best decision to go for With amazing music perfect view of the golf course beautiful seating arrangements and sophisticated ambience made the night worth remembering The New York cheesecake with blueberry sauce was good but I won t deny that I have tasted better cheesecakes before We ordered one pizza which was quite filling and with generous amount of smoked and mozzarella cheese was enough for two Special shoutout to the manager and the head waiter I apologize I don t remember his name but he definitely needs some appreciation I remember he said he was from Delhi and also Kolkata who was very courteous and offered us a complementary dessert This definitely made our night because it tasted so good The menu might be little overpriced according to many but for us with smart selection of dishes it was not a hole in the pocket Overall it was an outstanding visit A small suggestion if they could include candle dining that would elevate the romantic ambience of the place ,5.0,2
Aromas@11SIX,3 5 by me The food was quite good 4 5 5 for taste We ordered Paneer Achari Tikka and Paneer Butter Masala both of which were quite good nothing to complain about The butter rotis were a little overcooked but ok Service was also good Points deducted for cleanliness as the outside area was infested with fleas so wasn t able to get the dhaba style experience with benches and lanterns which made the outside experience desirable the inside seating was good tough ,4.0,2
AB's - Absolute Barbecues,Visited with office friends First things first the staff was very polite and prompt They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil overcook the food but on insisting politely changed the barbecue Coming to the food Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer mushroom crispy corn potato etc for starters So yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too Non vegetarian starters had basic chicken tandoori leg fish prawns mutton seek kabab must try Etc The main course like any other buffet place was not that interesting Noodles being one of my personal favourite were a little disappointing The sweet section would make anyone happy A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close the sweet cornor was refilled on time Again kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience ,4.0,2

The Glass Onion,I will start off by talking about it s ambience and location which I believe and am sure most will agree are it s highlights Located inside the serenity of Boulder hills away from the hullabaloo of the busy city it offers a sense of calm The simple yet elegant decor is what clicked for me right from the moment I walked in It has both and indoor and outdoor sitting The indoor sitting though comfortable and well lit I would suggest the outdoor one simply because of the view it has to offer The streches of green pasture of the golf club adjacent to it and the mild breeze that blows across it definitely refreshes your soul as you sit sipping on your drink I visited it on a summer evening and it was a pleasant experience to say the least Now coming to the food and beverages part definitely a little on the bulkier side but you got to expect that from a place like this located in the midst of all VIP locality The cocktails are good and do ask the waiter for in house food specialities which may not be mentioned in the menu And yes they have a novel concept of High tea served along with alcoholic beverages which is served during the early hours of the evening 4 7 pm with the set up they have I believe this is a must try Overall it s a nice place to spend a quiet afternoon or evening with family or friends P S Don t go there looking for dance and high pitch music you might be disappointed ,4.0,2

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,This place is very common to the corporate people who work in DLF and its premises for its reasonable price and food with perfect quantity and quality The only thing i would suggest everyone is do not opt takeaway homedelivery for waffles because when hot waffles are made they are immediately stored in plastic boxes due to which hot air is released by the waffles and condenses in the box itself thus it becomes very soft and disgusting to eat I have ordered Best of both worlds Reg Waffles pancakes scrambled eggs and cold coffee and Veg iron monster panneer biryani and coke pancakes were yummy along with maple sauce scrambled eggs were amazingly toasted without using much oil panneer biryani was just ok a bit more flavoured Cold coffee tasted like regular one Packing quality needs to be improved ,4.0,2

T Grill,A randomly sudden decision took me and a couple of my colleagues to this place on a weekday lunch we were unsure of our choice when we saw a few people sitting under the open huts and dining in the heat wave But the moment I opened what seemed like a kitchen door I was thrown aback to see 100s of people belting some South Indian meat Man this place is an oasis in the Puppalguda desert We being mutton lovers ordered a nalli starter and charcoal mutton chops looking at the crowd we were mentally prepared to go back to office in the evening post chai break but the waiter promptly brought the food in less than 10 minutes with a scalpel like tool with which we were to operate the nalli Our eyes shone The nalli did not disappoint us we then dug into the chops all my hours spent in drooling at pork ribs on YouTube were redeemed this mutton chops did the deed the meat wasn t the slimy fatty kind melting off the bones but was the perfectly grilled meat willing to separate from the ribs at our mildest effort we were already dreaming of another plate but decided against it in the best interests of our bellies then came the main course rotis mamasam pachadi and chicken biriyani first bite of the mamasam pachadi threw our chairs back by 5 feet we decided to ask the waiter to pack the biriyani and order another round of rotis to honour the pachadi for a person who consciously keeps away from gongura chutneys this one which clearly had gongura was just perfectly sour a bit more sour and I wouldn t have cared to write this review the meat was invisible we had to spot a narrow bone in the pachadi to even know there was mutton it was just mystically Omni present in the meat I guess this is what you would call divine food amen ,5.0,2

Hyderabadi Daawat,Hyderabadi Daawat as the name suggests has some authentic Hyderabadi food which you get to eat in the functions here in Hyderabad Ever been to a Hyderabadi Daawat before No not the hotel we re talking about a function well if you ve been to one then You definitely know how much a Hyderabadi loves food and how much he spends on the Menu And here at Hyderabadi Daawat the restaurant you get the same splendid variety of dishes to enjoy The hotel is very easy to locate Its on the main road while coming from ORR or Gachibowli side it comes on the right side and if you re coming from Miyapur side then it will be on Your left The restaurant has simple yet beautiful interiors very calm and cozy place They also have Banquet hall and a Conference hall and they also undertake Catering orders for parties and functions And after the DASTAR was set we sat down for the food and they first brought the YAKHNI SHORBA Shorba is nothing but the soup Yakhni Shorba is a dish from Kashmir people in the North tend to have it more And it is a very good source of protein Usually it is mild in spice level but at Hyderabadi Daawat owing to the spice cravings of Hyderabadis it was made a little spicy But the taste was fantastic It was the best way to start off Your meal Next came the starters in which we were served the Wok tossed chicken Phuket fish Sikandari Raan and Murgh Sholay kebab Let s start with what we loved the most The Sikandari Raan It s one whole leg from the Goat or Sheep You know for a fact that Mutton and Beefs aren t usually as tender as Chicken but the chefs at Hyderabadi Daawat changed this notion entirely The mutton from the Raan was soo soft tender and juicy that Your teeth has no work to do cause it just MELTS And talking about the spices it was very mild in spice and very well marinated Coming to the significance of the name SIKANDARI RAAN Most of You must be knowing that Alexander the Great who had captured almost all parts of the world was known as Sikandar e Azam After winning one of the battles in 300 B C at Takshila he took the ruler called Porus as captive and when Porus was asked what he wanted He told he wanted them to treat him like a king and soo Alexander or Sikandar took him as his friend and arranged for a lavish buffet in which this Raan was signature dish And since then it is named as Sikandari Raan Well we think no other name would have justified the Size and Taste of this dish better than Sikandari Raan A must must have for You all Highly recommended dish if You re here The next best starter was the Phuket fish It s a nice spicy fish coated with finely chopped onions ginger garlic paste and tossed in Soya and Chilli sauce The taste was of another level Next we had the Wok tossed chicken Wok tossed is an East Asian style of cooking where they use woks or metal pans with shallow bowls used for frying or steaming The taste of the chicken was really good with all rightly mixed flavours and spices but it was a bit hard to chew Soo we recommend the chef to look into that And next came the Murgh Sholay Kebab It was the Barbeque styled chicken Very nicely marinated and tender to eat And the presentation was amazingly done After we were done with the starters they brought a very appealing and extremely beautiful dish called Chelo Kebab It was extremely well presented Chelo kebab is an Iranian Dish in which there is cooked rice along with varieties of chicken kebabs The chicken and the rice as well is too mild in spice but rich in flavour After this the main course was started in which we were served the Chicken Lababdar Nihari Gosht and Murgh Musallam with Butter Naan Nihari Gosht was Love it wasn t like the usual Nihari that You eat on a regular basis It was different and very thick and spicy And the mutton which they used was really tender Do try this dish here Chicken lababdar was really lababdar along with the butter naan it was a perfect combo Murgh Musallam was completely different here when compared to the Murgh Musallam we had at other places Here they serve the Murgh Musallam with rice And the meat is filled with minced mutton and eggs You should definitely try this dish We were done with all this but how can You even think that a Hyderabadi daawat would end without the Hyderabadi Biryani We had the Mutton Biryani it was very rich in flavours and seasoned with good amount of roasted onions The aroma of the Ghee added to the taste of the Biryani And the Daawat came to an end with the desserts You commonly find in a Hyderabadi Daawat Matka Firni and Double ka Meetha Double ka Meetha is the very usual dish You see in the functions of Hyderabad It is made with roasted breads to which milk cinnamon and almond powder are added And at Hyderabadi Daawat it was perfectly made and was served Hot Overall the lunch here was a Terrific experience and we all just loved it And also a special mention to the Owner of this place who is a very Kind hearted and a humble person He speaks to You related anything and everything You have to ask or tell and takes the Feedback whether good or bad with a smile Way to go Sir ,5.0,2

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,It s been a very long desire to taste the pan Asian food at Zega very beautiful place with a spectacular view from the outlet well balanced ambience with nice live kitchen and interactive bar coming to the service its seems very low manned for every order we have to stand up and request someone to attend for our request taste of the food was just ok need to relook into the clasic dishes over all it was a very average dining experience at zega ,2.0,0
Chinese Pavilion,Amazing food good ambience great service this is what describes Chinese Pavilion Their Chinese is blended in Indian flavors that is what makes it so special The chopsuey all chicken non veg gravies are worth trying here along with fish prawn starters The best part about their food is it isn t bland it is mixed with Indian flavors ensuring the Chinese name stays to it preventing it to be less spicy If you want to try something different within the Chinese cuisine this place won t disappoint you And the service is awesomely good as the servers there wont just serve you with a smile but also recommend their best dishes and can even customise your dishes as per your choice I am going with a 4 5 because I beliebe the efforts put by their team should be appreciated and I request every foodie to visit this place This is honestly one of the few Chinese places that serve chinese cuisine with an Indian touch Worth a visit any day ,4.5,0
Prism Club & Kitchen,This place charges both an entry fee and a cover charge We ordered the wasabi prawns what they delivered was great but I tasted no wasabi so our order was clearly wrong The cinderella mock tail was insanely sweet no one at our table could finish it Despite promising us for over an hour to find us an indoor table they sat us outdoor with the mosquitos which they weren t able to control with citronella sticks The dance floor was very active with an amazing DJ though not nearly enough AC so it smelled like sweaty guys ,2.0,0

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,During our stay at Radisson we had our breakfast here and it was very good experience compared to its peers in the area Breakfast review A typical buffet everyday seems very wide spread with options for everyone There are about 10 Indian options like Idlis wada dosas to order pav bhaji puris parathas to order upma poha etc I couldn t try everything but the paneer paratha was very good and I totally recommend The bakery counter has multiple selections too that comprises of different bread rolls basic breads butter filled croissants choices of donuts excellent cupcakes etc They also have several selections of beverages hot and cold and soy drinks too vegan options on request variants of muesli and cereals choice of cheese salads fruits etc They have western cold cuts etc and Asian noodles and rice alternatives too Pros Widespread buffet most of the spread is very good in taste helpful staff comfortable seating Suggestion Would be nice if the staff smiles and makes it more welcoming Recommended Buffets touryard com,4.5,0

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,This review has been long overdue and i have finally managed to get some time out to do so So 4 of us visited Mazzo on the 14th of Feb and chose the Veg Non Veg options accordingly from their menu pre decided At 2500 INR plus taxes per head we expected the basics quality service excellent food Imagine our shock when we received exactly the opposite 1 The linen on the table we were seated at had cigarette holes in it 2 The livery was stained 3 The restaurant hadn t set up yet even though it was 2130 hrs by the time we arrived 4 Instead of being given comfortable seating we were given plastic chairs with white wraps on them 5 The Cream of Asparagus soup was like toilet water So was the Avocado Chicken Corn Chowder Soup They refused to give us extra croutons because we ve already eaten too many What else is one supposed to do when you are served such bad tasting soup 6 The Bharwab Subz Kebab was dry like dried meat the Grilled Buffalo Chicken was terrible smelling only How to eat the Lamb Galouti was decent and the Vegetable Lumpia was oily and tiny All in All the appetizers were equally useless 7 Moving onto the Main course now For the Vegetarian Me i was given a choice between the Anjeer Kesar Kofte and Spinach Ricotta Ravioli I obviously chose the latter D uh Big Mistake When i asked the server why the ravioli was so dry i was told that the halogen lamp made it so Then why keep it under the lamp for so long And the former you ask it was so sweet it was like drinking Chaasni the sugar water from the Rasgulla or Gulab Jamun dabba 8 Not like the Non Vegetarians had it any better 6 Hours Braised Lamb Shank OR Nalli Nihari OR Murgh Methi Lamb It was more bones than lamb and also baby lamb Such a tiny piece that my husband had to eat another dinner after we got home Nalli Nihari More like Nal ka Paani No taste no Nihari Murgh Methi WhyWhyWhy so many bones in a dosh which one assumes is boneless and that too in a 5 star hotel Roti you ask Please DO NOT 9 And last but not the least Dessert Vanilla Bean Pannacotta I make better Pannacotta and i just wanted to cry The coulis was just sugar water with some red colouring Kesar Malai Kulfi This was bought from Scoops The server told us also The only thing on the menu that tasted fantastic Ate 4 and went home ,1.0,0

Labonel,When we order something special for a loved ones birthday apart from the value there are always sentiments attached to it My sister aspires to start her own bakery and holds Labonel Fine Baking in high regard Keeping this in minds we thought a Labonel cake will make her birthday more special We ordered the cake 1 week in advance and had confirmed the order the previous day We also spoke to them the very same day we were supposed to pick up the cake Both the times we were informed by their staff that the store is open on 23rd Sept till 6pm this is after you ignore the fact that their official timing is 7pm They decide to call me on the day of pickup at 4 50pm to inform me that they will shut down at 5 30pm So not only was i expected to drop whatever i was doing at a moment s notice i believe they expected me to teleport to their store Well since the cake held sentimental value for me I did leave immediately and rushed to the Gachibowli store I made it there by 5 10pm and can you imagine my dismay when I saw that the store was closed To add to it no one answered the phone I stood there for 30 minutes trying to get in touch with them on multiple phone numbers on the website but there was no response I could not believe that a renown place could be this unprofessional If they cannot value their customers and have no regard for others time and sentiments I do not think it would ever matter how their product is My sister no longer considers them a role model as she values her customers more than having a fancy store with expensive products Since they did not contact me back even the next day I feel the only option left then is to complain on social media and hence this post I hope this falls on deaf ears of Labonel owners I know I will not be repeating the mistake of ordering something from this place and to anyone who reads this you have been warned Update I have a facebook post which certifies that minimum 5 friends of mine have dealt with similar bad experiences ,1.0,0

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,The rating for the food taste is always 4 5 here but when comes to service I can t rate more than 1 5 5 the 0 5 is just for getting bill quickly and may be 1 for getting few dishes immediately I visited this restaurant for the fifth time expecting to get better food and service than last time but it is always degrading We came in to Lunch at around 2 45 the first thing which irritated was they were served me cold starters and I complained then they went and heated it up and served this was corn cubes they promised 11 started in the buffet menu and they never bothered to serve all I had to ask him to check what the menu was and can he serve all of them and still they never served I think they were supposed to serve soup at table along with starters which they always did before I went and asked them about it then they said it is available at the buffet section and we can go and get it I really felt like going to a place where they were serving free food and we had to go and ask for what we wanted It was absolutely ridiculous experience they started turning off the lights when we re still eating I agree we were late but switch off all the lights and we go out in a kind of darkness It is no more pathetic situation like they are not bothered about the customers and we can get in if we want I was always thinking Urban Asia is a premium place for good food and service but it proved other wise ,1.0,0

Pot Pourri,Had been here to taste authentic andhra telangana Cuisine Tried the Cashew chicken starter and the Prawn biriyani The starter was nothing but boneless chicken fried in some bland batter with fried cashew stuck to it It looked like some home made beginner dish It was really dry The server even forgot to give me chutney with it The only thing andhra about the biriyani was the spice level It was above normal levels Otherwise no special flavour The dish didnt have enough salt which we added later OURSELF There was some birthday party going on because of which each dish took an hour to get to us After all this hassle they give us complimentary gulab jamun from the buffet which was nowhere a compensation for the bad experience or for the price we paid I am just hoping this isnt the real telangana cuisine which it is famous for and I was just at the wrong place ,2.0,0

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,We went on a weekend to this place as we had been wanting to try out this new place in town for a while Starting of with the pros the decor and ambiance of this place is really good The menu is quite interesting too and includes a variety of chicken pork beef and some fish dishes There are a few vegetarian options but I do not know to what extent it would satisfy a vegetarian They have a good choice of mocktails as well and each one was really good The pork ribs and the mushrooms were good too The staff there was good too Moving on to why I chose to give this a bad review first of all the service was really slow Took about an hour for my food to arrive Moreover my chicken noodles tasted exactly like Maggie with a few chicken pieces thrown in I had attached a picture of it for reference Moreover the portion sizes are quite small in relation to the price of the dishes A small bowl of beef curry was 200 and one plate of steamed rice was not even enough for two people Even though the taste was good because of the portion sizes and the relative prices plus the service time our experience was ruined Hence the two stars ,2.0,0

Pista House,Went for a team lunch The place is opposite Care Hospital Ambiance This place has normal ambiance as all the other Irani hotels The problem is that there are a lot of Swiggy delivery boys and they waiting outside the door to collect their parcels We felt bad sitting there while they were peering inside in the hot sun and us eating there Food quality We ordered three items 1 Devils Chicken Chewy chicken coated This was the best dish of the lot 2 Tandoori Chicken fully burnt coated with ghee to hide the bad quality 3 Premium Biryani This was really bad When people go to a Irani style hotel there are some expectations We like Biriyani dum cooked This particular Biriyani costed 650 and came in a slightly large bowl Please be careful as this can only serve 3 people The Rice was passable and the Biriyani was fully mixed Not the layering like it is supposed to be It textured like a pulao with the masala The chicken manchuri in it was cold and the coating had fallen off You can tell that is was stale The Chicken pieces were only bones the mutton pieces were not existent This looks like a outlet which is run by fake people Biryani and food items in traditional hotels like Paradise Shah Ghouse Mehfil Shahdab Bawarchi are really good The tandoori chicken will normally be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside The service took a long time in coming It looks like they are short of staff People will go there by the name and feel bad I feel the Pista house owners should look into quality and quantity issues This outlet is making a fast buck in the Hitech area where floating population is heavy ,1.0,0

Marsala Food Company,The food of the place was nice except for Murg Malai Tikka the dish was very sweet and not worth for money The reason for giving 1 star rating is my experience in the restaurant which was not only food but also the staff which were very very rude not only while serving food but also while taking order and explaining certain dishes which were named differently on the menu The staff doesn t know how to treat with customers they were unnecessarily speaking and poking nose in our personal conversation and behaving miserably with the people there pretending that is cool behaviour Overall good place to order food from the last place one should go for dine in The staff should learn how to behave with the customers 1 star is also too much depending upon how the staff behaved with us last night when I went with a group of friends ,1.0,0

The Glass Onion,It was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place I reserved a table for us on the same day itself To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had I was delighted to see the place at first Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us after reserving the table and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner like local restraunts and they gave us the menu The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side the food was not worth the price it tasted more like any other local restraunt The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland it was sweet and barely had any flavour seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us overall a bad experience verdict on the face of it the ambience was nice the service and food were not upto the mark Very dissappointing indeed ,1.0,0

Pista House,I am so disappointed with what I just had today from Pista House Gachibowli that I don t think it would be sensible on my part to even award a single star rating but unfortunately zomato is not allowing me to publish the review without rating hence this 1 star I have had Mutton Kheema Biriyani earlier from Pista House Kondapur Nizampet both of which were awesome and of the same taste make however the same didn t turn true for Kheema biriyani from the Gachibowli outlet All my friends who had the biriyani today shares the same opinion so I am not being overly critical at all I don t understand how such reputed brands chain do not maintains consistency of taste recipe across all the outlets they do maintain consistency with the prices though Not sure if Pista House would be be even interested to take this comment seriously OR act upon it to get things better for next time but at least I request that they don t cheat on their customer s expectations What was bad with the biriyani 1 It was all rice and no kheema 2 This is NOT at all the same recipe that is being served in other outlets Nizampet Kondapur 3 Trivial though but the packaging is also inconsistent as compared to other outlets while other outlets packs in Container Pista House Gachibowli deliver in foil packet My order details Through Swiggy Order No 16352555425 2 portions of supposed to be Kheema Biriyani NO Thanks for ruining the Friday lunch experience ,1.0,0

Eat India Company,I have been to Eat India Company twice To Sum up my experience I found the service Sloppy and mindless Food has fluctuating standards here for a meal that cost almost 2k for 2 people without drinks one would expect at least some good to come out of the most basic cuisines The kadhai paneer which should have been lip smacking and flavourful was totally bland The service was so lethargic that I had to wait almost 30 minutes for my food on a day when only 3 4 tables were booked The only positive side of this place is the ambiance which is great authentic artifacts from the past add a good aurora but the place needs to step up its game in terms of food that they offer P S I was pretty excited about going to this place but unfortunately my experience was so bad that I shall never visit this one again ,2.0,0

eat.fit,AVOID This place is a scam If there is even a place I cannot find the physical restaurant on google maps by the provided address Anyway I ordered a healthy chicken breast dish They claim to offer healthy dishes and organic ingredients which look fantastic on the photos Then you get regular oily fatty suspiciously saucy Indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand The only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion No wonder it is low on calories you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites There were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it maybe 25gr total submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce I doubt it was even grilled It looked and tasted more like it was fried although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows The picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only plus the sides on other plates I should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but I was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food At least it wasn t too expensive but definitely not healthy not cheap and not good quality food ,1.0,0

Gal Punjab Di,I visited this place with my friend It is there right in the heart of Gachibowli s Indiranagar vinayak nagar Upon entering you will definitely feel good and like a family restaurant which it is The ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off There are some corner sittings which many may or may not like and then there were chairs where fitting in was a bit tight Then comes the interaction with the staff They are quite friendly and hard working too They do have a quick serving time but thing is their attire was not up to the mark Menu had a wide variety of items and at some decent rates I really liked the way they split between veg and non veg food We ordered quite a lot of stuff but I really liked the dahi kebab It was good But with such good starter I had pinned my hopes on Patiala lassi But that was an anti climax of sorts They used essence for the lassi I hope they start making more authentic lassi with a malai on top That will surely be a game changer Overall it was a mixed experience and hence 3 5 ,3.0,1

Beyond Flavours,The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables We went on Friday afternoon We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn t get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer ,3.0,1
Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,We went for a family dinner on 15th April Being a 5 star restaurant some basic amenities were missing which you can easily get in any local drive in or a dhaba Noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 7 8 min whereas in any other 5 star a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry However we went inside and opted for a buffet The food spread was very good however few of them were cold roast chkn and fish tikka The fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert The most annoying thing was the on the table service The table wasnt ready when we were seated We had to ask for napkin spoon fork and even for a glass of water Multiple times The empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean The taste of the food was good though and thats the only reason for me giving a 3 star ,3.0,1

Aromas@11SIX,This place is located in khajaguda It used to be one of my favorite places because of the taste quantity and pricing I used to visit this place every weekend or in fact twice a week Food is no doubt good their soups starters dal makhani etc However there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden Prices have been almost doubled I used to have a dal makhani at 180 rs and now its priced at 300 rs I believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost 50 is really a good decision with no changes in ambience I believe their main USP was good food at affordable prices at a decent ambience Even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and Moti Mahal have lower prices and better ambience With hike in prices customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience fancy cutlery on the table well decorated tables and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use well dressed waiters etc Hope the management would rethink ,3.0,1
Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,Ambience Peaceful place to hangout with a small group especially during late nights Service after two visits I can say the service is consistent just like any other top hotels in the same league Food Yes I must say the burger is mediocre I went for the tenderloin burger cooked medium This patty has some herbs mixed in it so if you like some rosemary and thyme in your patty try it out For 850 rupees including taxes I can say it s on par with other offerings in the city with a different twist to their burger 3 5 stars for their burger ,3.0,1

Aromas@11SIX,If you have no value for money then this restaurant is good to waste your money Reason for giving 3 is due to veg curries which were told be good by my vegan friends But we non veg guys were totally disappointed for non veg curries It s got no taste at all Chilli chicken gravy was like saucy saucy No spicy at all Butter rotis were thicker than it usually has to be It tasted like wheat flour and not maida Service Good Taste Below average Ambiance Good Cost High,3.0,1

Hyper Local,The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too The ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up The utilisation of the limited space is done well A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set Moving on to the food we tried the newly launched Drudge menu Priced at Rs 1200 this was an expensive affair However if you are early I e before 4 30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for 799 They had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food The drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler The buffet Consisted of golgappe Dahi bhalle Sev puri bruschetta mini veg and non veg pizza Dahi kachori chole bhature red Thai curry with rice chicken tikka fries noodles and chicken tikka pockets Golgappe Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste Dahi kachori was a complete let down The bruschetta stood out and pizza was average Chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren t crisp The red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation Noodles were randomly kept with no gravy The chicken tikka pockets were dry The chicken tikka was good and marinated very well Overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn t go together The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn t sound correct The music was extremely loud for the place Overall we had a below average Experience Based on the drunch menu I would rate it 2 5 5,3.0,1
Shanghai Chef 2,Ok place The food was just fine but since it is reasonably priced its decent value for money Service is ordinary though On a sunday afternoon the place was empty and it was hard to digest I almost went out but then decided to give it a try anyway Bottom line if i want to eat relatively inexpensive Chinese food then this might be a choice else no ,3.0,1
Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,The buffet here costs Rs 399 for both Veg Non Veg but it finishes before it even starts Limited options are there hence didn t like it much Preparation is fine the crowd is average ambience is like a normal restaurant If you are strapped then only visit it ,3.0,1
Hyderabadi Daawat,A newly opened Daawat restaurant on Kondapur road We visited on Saturday evening without prior booking The decor is elegant and spacious with comfortable sitting We ordered Mojito and Ginger peach mocktails along with Daawat khas veg kebab platter Mocktails were good but little too sweet Veg platter was good but nothing excellent Paneer particularly wasn t so fresh We directly went for Veg and Chicken dum Biryanis Again both were just ok and quality of rice was just ordinary Overall the ambience and service is good but food is just average and not so rich You can visit this place for casual dining with friends and families ,3.0,1

Kritunga Restaurant,I had ordered food from Kritunga many times to my office and had visited this place once Gachibowli The ambience here is good and the staff was attentive The steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry it was very delicious I also tried gongura chicken it was fine Apart from these I tried spl chicken biryani kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery Overall i would say the food here is good a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies Packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order it would great if the food could be packed in boxes ,3.0,1
Tandoori Food Works,The first time I ordered their Chicken Tikka Biryani I became fan of it Loved it so much that I recommended it to my friends and colleagues as well The second time I ordered it the quantity was very less compared to the first time and tasted different as well I ve got the same sort of feedback from friends also that their food is inconsistent in taste quantity and its a hit or miss I would sincerely suggest them to be consistent in quality and quantity both as they ve got good potential ,3.0,1

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,I had ordered out everytime The packaging is excellent although the food is okayish The shawarma is like having roti and malai chicken The rumali roti is soft and the filling inside is moist There was not punch of flavour but a monotony on the pallette Also their waffles are okayish too ,3.0,1

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Sardarji s chaats and more is synonymous with the typical street food in Delhi and is nostalgia served in a plate all over for people who have for any point of time savored on the street food in delhi The sandwiches especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome The dahi bhalla dahi papdi s are good too However off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food Another complaint i had with them are their parathas they are bad polar opposite to their chaat dishes I would never recommend anyone ordering paratha s from this place and I tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked This is the reason I have rated them as 3 out 5 ,3.0,1

Mustang Terrace Lounge,With an impressive location it could have been one of the prime spots but the placement of items seems unimaginative The ambiance created with the light bulbs is utterly ruined with a large screen in the middle of the room The sound system needs improvement with focus on more than just base The food is good and it was worth the wait in this decrepit atmosphere The outdoor seats are not as comfortable and there is no measure to tackle scenarios of rain It is a decent place to just have food but expect nothing more,3.0,1
Absolute Sizzlers,I had ordered the smoked chicken pasta in red sauce I wouldn t say it was the worst but it was not up there There was no smokiness like the name claimed just bland chicken and rather a trail mix of vegetables that didn t really need to be there in it in the first place I would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no of vegetables maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out Also the smoked chicken needs to be upgraded The spaghetti was also slightly overcooked ,3.0,1

Eat India Company, Disappointed Went for dinner with friends Was bit disappointed with the service and food Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor Which make service bit slow and confused We opted for buffet here also they served fusion of both the restaurant For example they served chicken sorba for non veg and Khaw Souy for veg It s simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great ,3.0,1
Marsala Food Company,Been to this place after looking at the ratings We had a mushroom Moti tikka for starter which tasted sweet and we could barely finish the starter due to its sweetness In the main course we had chicken biryani which was just decent with bland taste and little masala The service was decent and so as the ambience I would rate this place as Food 3 5 Service 3 5 5 Ambience 3 5 5,3.0,1

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,We had dinner at this place last night The spread was quite lavish but we personally felt that non vegetarian dishes were less when compared to the pricing of the buffet The food was average as compared to the other Hyatt at Banjara Hills The only thing I enjoyed was the fresh ravioli pasta they were serving And also they had no soft drinks included in the buffet which is quite stingy But the service is top notch and the staff always keeps a tap at your table and was eager to serve us which was great ,3.0,1

Frio Bistro,I m reviewing a delivery order I ve ordered spaghetti aglio e olio from this place It was soaking in oil and very less quantity The packing seemed like it was done in a hurry with minimum care No spoon fork and tissues were given with the pack I really liked the way they didn t backout when it came to adding olives and cherry tomatoes Keeping the oil aside the taste was good However there is scope for improvement because I ve read good things about this place and their food Didn t expect it to be like this ,3.0,1
KS Bakers,A new place that slowly turned out into a hangout eatery for people with shallow pockets The lighting ambience is warm I love eating the chicken roll that hardly costs 35 bucks A burger costs only 70 Lot of University students depend on KS for a cheap dinner delivery You get free chips with everything you order But personally I felt the cheese they use is a bit weird about sweet for the taste of a traditional Pizza hut afficianado ,3.0,1

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Filtered entry Check Welcome assistance Check Crowd Check Ambience Check What s great Nothing It s a good sports bar with zero sense of consumer experience when it comes to to service and value for money Half the order doesn t come on time you ll have to repeatedly pesture your waiter who just keeps running half the time The fancy sports bar is not adequately staffed and even though they filter the crowd by putting a stag entry fee which is covered too many people are stiffed inside and I don t think they have the ability to serve the kind of crowd they attract Overall I liked the food and the place but it was a disappointment that night We left to a more peaceful place for the rest of night The cocktails are good though ,3.0,1

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,I was pretty excited looking at the 4 6 rating But quite disappointed I would rate the food at 4 though But service is extremely poor The staff isn t good at recommending dishes The Beef curry with Naga chilli isn t good probably because they had overused some condiment giving it a bitter taste The pork belly was good Beef fry wasn t great because meat was undercooked The steam country chicken curry was good I would give this restaurant another chance and come back again because I really love the food from the north east and then order something which would be actually good and worth the rating it boasts right now ,3.0,1

Arena Eleven,Experience at Arena Eleven Since it s in SLN Terminus mall it s not very difficult to find It was a Friday when we had dinner here and the experience it wasn t the best although it could be Place was packed by 9 9 30 pm Definitely this place has the potential to improve and become better One big minus point is that on a Friday evening the washroom was out of order and I had to cross all SLN third floor to get to the toilet Ups that s really bad Ambiance is vibrant atmosphere is good but the music is too loud Usually I don t mind the music but here was really difficult to have a conversation They have screens and it s a good place to watch some sports There is some kind of terrace too and that s good till the hot summer Service was good regarding the waiters but really slow in bringing the food out from the kitchen They also have to change their menus or something because many items we tried to order weren t available like burgers pizza etc On a Friday evening pizza and burgers definitely will be ordered When it comes to the food we had enjoyed thoroughly some items but others were just average We had sizzling kebab platter Chipotle and jamaican chicken and lemon and pepper fish we choose Awesome kebabs Really juicy and tasty every each one of them We had sizzling mint biryani which also was delicious They didn t give any mirch ka salaan raitha or onion with the biryani just plain but I asked for some raitha and they brought Rice was flavoured and chicken was tender but just 4 small pieces The let down were the rolls We had 4 different types of rolls with fries and wedges Maximum average on quality and taste The price is on the expensive side but it still worth a try at least for the kebabs Food 3 5 5 Ambiance 3 5 Service 3 5 5 Value 3 5,3.0,1

Shree Santosh Dhaba Family Restaurant, ,3.0,1
NorFest - The Dhaba,The place is located in the food court of SLN Terminus and the first branch of Norfest in the city The seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole As it was winter we were fortunate to have Makki ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag The Makki ki Roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan Saag was good but lacked salt in it The flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it The next thing was Amritsari Kulcha and Chole a must try and must have at Norfest The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good The final dish was the Paneer Lababdaar and Garlic Naan the curry again lacked salt and was not upto the mark in terms of taste So overall not recommended VFM 4 5 Taste 3 5,3.0,1

PourHouse7,We visited this place today A decent rooftop place with good ambience ipl screening okayish food and dj The service is a tad bit slow giving a resemblance of a place not visited often Though it was a weekend and strat of ipl season the place bore a deserted look Dj was good and adapted according to the crowd We started off with Butter garlic prawns and chicken popcorn Both of them turned out to be very oily We further ordered Fish tikka which was okayish Masala papad was in good quantity and tastier for a change They wer unable to manage a bunch of hooligan crowd who were throwing beer around unable to differentiate it with champagne If you are in a group and want a place not heavy on ur pocket can opt for PourHouse7 ,3.0,1

Beyond Flavours,Short review Decent breads and starters bad Shaam Savera a little screwed up daal makhni but should be a one off case Better ambience at night And importantly good quantity I wanted to give a 2 5 but that s not an option Extensive Ambience It s better at night Friends who had been here during the day didn t like it much So if you prefer ambience go at night Food Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab Shaam Savera Daal Makhni rotis and raita Yes I m a vegetarian The good part Quantity I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu But take it from me you do not want to order it It is no where close to what it should be They messed it up real bad especially the colors The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me It wasn t creamy too The breads and raita were decent The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too soft They had an extra outer coating of peanuts So if you re not a peanut fan on your kebabs ask them to skip that step Conclusion It looked like they had made food in a hurry Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases If things change you ll know ,3.0,1

Delhi-39,Ordered a lot from this place and went for dine in a lot of times as well The biggest issue with this place is lack of consistency It is okay for the price range but the quality and taste of food will be a surprise almost every time We usually have Mushroom Masala Usually quite good with good amount of mushrooms Garlic Naan Nice and crispy Mixed Raita This has always been good In terms of ambience it has very less to offer and an okayish service ,3.0,1
Hyper Local,Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200 per person The place itself is located in a good open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer My experience with their food was decent The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle Dahi Vade Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe Speaking about their main course they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature Veg Hakka Noodles Red thai curry Chicken pizza Steamed Rice Chicken tikka Chicken wings and Chicken pockets Looking at the price of the drunch I feel a bit more items should have been on offer Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious However they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout The best part about the place was the drinks section Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail Sangria and Cranberry Cooler Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place All in all the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes Happy eating ,3.0,1

Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,I came here for a buffet The overall experience was average They have a huge spread to choose from only in the salads and when it comes down to starters and main course i was pretty disappointed because of pretty limited options i had to choose from even from which there was just a single starter that made me even think about seconds The deserts were decent i loved the chocolate ice cream Moving on to ambience the seating and the restaurant was pretty decent and i think the true look and feel could be experienced at its best if you were to visit the place for a dinner The service was pretty swift Food 2 5 Ambience 4 5 Overall 3 5,3.0,1

eat.fit,For the first time tried the light lunch meal from Eat fit which has 450Kcal as mentioned Decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box Chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil Chapatis were homely soft and warm something a bit hard to get in Hyderabad A less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier Not sure if I would order this again but could maybe try their salads ,3.0,1

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,It was a night out with gal pals When we entered the server took us to our sitting area we chose a corner as it had a couch felt it was bit secluded Warm indoors black and brown seatings cartoons of laal street their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the TV They have their own app for ordering but guess what their wifi wasn t available as it was under repair That is what server told us The server came and took our orders We ordered starters and drinks As soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere It kind of scared us then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation Then we started enjoying the music and our orders came The server got one of the drinks wrong we reminded him it was changed he said he already brought this Other places the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast Instead he said he cant take it back Anyways moving on The cocktail which i had were really good The cosmopolitan Beer trap and Screw driver The starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian Italian cheese fingers They were crispy and yum Stuffed mushrooms they were okay and forgettable the Nachos were okay have had better ones The crispy corn was good Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters The music was good Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it first they said at 9 30 they will start then said 10 30 it will start We four were only on the dance floor we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song He didnt oblige at all Would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills God knows Food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar Hope they improve their hospitality That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again Food 3 5 Service 3 5 Overall experience 4 5 Because of friends VFM 3 5 5,3.0,1

Arena Eleven,It s during this time of the year where the cricket fanactics are on a lookout for places offering sports screenings and feel almost heartbroken not to find any dedicated sports bar in town But not to worry as Arena Eleven s here to woo the same crowd with their delightful sports themed decor offering big screen match telecasts for sports and all that coming with a beautiful rooftop ambience Located at Level 4 of SLN Terminus Mall in Gachibowli the tagline for the place is Kebabs Beers Sports each of which is incorporated in the menu as well as the setting quite aptly The menu for the place is particularly compact serving only a selective few Indian and Oriental preparations both in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian diets Sampling their vegetarian appetizer from the a la carte section we ended up calling for their Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries both of which turned out to be pretty good The platter came with 3 different tikkas of our choice namely Veg Shami Peri Peri and Lemon Pepper Paneer Tikka on a sizzling hot plate with onions on the base Veg Shami was something that was absolutely mindblowing with a hint of heat both from chili and pepper with the perfectly soft texture Masala Fries was just a Indianized version of loaded fries with the crisp potatoes sauted in with onions ginger and garlic which worked as a good accompaniment for the drinks Non vegetarian section had some really nice dishes including the Tangri Kebab Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka and Honey Chili Chicken Wings which were just perfect for a setting of this kind My personal favourite was their Lemon Pepper Fish however for the juicy and succulent fish chunks giving that lipsmacking balance of citrus and heat from the lemon juice and black pepper marination Honey Chili Wings too were pretty good as a finger food having crispy fried wings tossed in a sticky sweet honey chili sauce probably the best candidate to be had along with a couple of chilled beers Disappointing was their Chili Fish however which had no flavour whatsoever bland pieces of fish with the coating sauce containing just chili without any seasoning The kitchen should probably revisit the recipe and take care in seasoning the fried fish with some salt and pepper Running a buffet on weekends the place offers a beautiful selection of mains to the diners having a variety of Indian options to choose from Each of the diets had two curries on offer with a choice of breads and rice where the non vegetarian sect had Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani along with some delectable Chicken Tikka Biryani After the disappointment in the starters it almost came as a surprise how good both the mains were Chicken Curry had the home style onion base with juicy boneless chicken bites added going absolutely well with some hot Tandoori Rotis Same was the case with Murg Makhani as well however it had a bit too much of sweetness for my taste Trying out their Chicken Tikka Pizza from the a la carte section turned out to be a disaster as the puffy base seemed to be store bought and stale which definitely didn t justify the price tag for the same The dessert options too gave little to choose from where we went for the Gajar ka Halwa and Rice Kheer both of which were plain simple average The service too wasn t any exemplary as the staff almost at all times paid no heed to the diners calling them out for help Getting even a glass of water turned out to be a huge task however on multiple complaints the restaurant manager did mend things well The kitchen deserves appreciation for sending out dishes fast into the dining room however in the pace they almost always lacked consistency The dishes we ordered at the start of the meal when again called brought something entirely different and dreadful on a plate All in all if the place provides a run of the mill menu with a some good dishes but lacking the consistency to deliver entirely instagram com,3.0,1

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,An evening in THE Radisson itself is one it s kind And when the food is unlimited it s just bliss a heaven on earth We had booked a table via Nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality variety of dishes and a great ambience But somehow we don t know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it It is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that we don t know When I retrospect back home I thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there Not that they were rude but they didn t care much The manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us Well coming to the dishes we had a nice sumptuous dinner The best part was the dessert section If had a variety of spreads It was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes Oh boy I had a ball Had the staff had been a little attentive I d have rated an easy 4 0 I guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the Nearbuy But we ve been too many 5 star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently Taste 3 5 Ambience 3 5 Staff 2 5 Value for money 3 5,3.0,1

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,Hello everyone We visited this place a few days back and tried their buffet We were not happy with the quality of food served The variation was good enough There were 2 3 veg as well as non veg starters The main course also had 2 veg and non veg dishes each But the taste was not at all satisfying We expect this place will improve in future If what you read is in any way helpful for you do like the review and follow us We would be happy to bring in honest reviews about different restaurants all across India ,3.0,1
La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,We went to this place yesterday night for a colleague s farewell party This is situated adjacent to Over the moon hotel in Gachibowli We availed Zomato gold and got 2 2 drinks offer The staff was not polite and we were dissappointed with their behaviour there were a couple of instances when they didn t understand our request and were a bit rude in their behaviour In starters Paneer Tikka Chilli corn salt and pepper and Egg bhurji pao were good in taste and we enjoyed having them In main course we ordered Dal makhani and Paneer lababdar which were upto the expectations Nothing can be better than having a dessert to end the evening and we did the same by ordering Gulab jamun I must say it was one of the best gulab jamun s I have had until now Wanted to give them 3 5 rating but deducting 0 5 for staff behaviour ,3.0,1
Prism Club & Kitchen,By Invite The pub is located in the Financial District in Gachibowli the pub is currently the largest in Hyderabad in terms of area As you enter you cross your way through a large parking space and pathway to overlook a huge monkey like figure enjoying music The pub feels start as soon as a glance falls on the building with colorful lights The ambience inside is amazing and is spread over two floors with the ground floor having the huge dance floor and pubs and a seating area upstairs The USP of the dance floor is the literally lit up chandelier made of LED rings grooving to the beat of the music also the walls have lights synced to this There is also an outdoor seating where you can watch your favorite matches and when bored head to the dance floor back indoor Coming to the Food Punjabi Paneer Tikka Rs 325 Thick cubes of paneer marinated with mustard and curd base Was not soft and requires lot of improvement A strict no to this dish Burmese Rolls Rs 275 A different kind of spring rolls filled with corn garlic and cheese The taste was delectable with the right balance of flavors and enhanced by the sweet chilli dip The only issue was not that crispy and a bit more oily Mains For the mains we had Exotic Vegetables in Black Pepper with Rice the curry was just ok had a decent flavor but didn t have the distinctive flavor of the pepper sauce in it Prism Special Veg Pizza The thin crust pizza loaded with cheese and topped with veggies like zucchini was the best main course that we had among the served The pizza was decent in taste had not much of marinara base but was not bland either The pizza was although not crispy as we got busy catching up the tricks performed by the bartenders Apart from these we were also served Veg Pulao and Meloni Tarkari curry which was completely average and to be skipped Drinks Cucumber Coriander Mocktail The cucumber coriander mocktail was too sweet The flavor of cucumber had dominated the slight tinge of coriander Go Crazy The blend of Oreo and chocolates was nothing out of the box and tasted like a regular chocolate shake Recommended Dishes Burmese Rolls Prism Pizza If you need a main course The place is highly average in terms of food despite being an ideal place to enjoy the night life So is not recommended Food 3 5 Ambience 5 5 VFM 4 5,3.0,1

10 Downing Street,A very mediocre experience to be honest at the outset I have been to the same restaurant in other cities and had great expectations The ambience is delightful and the three stars are only attributed to that It has a rooftop setting and a nice band was performing live Coming to food and service I would rate it 1 5 We tried the jalape o cheese poppers horrible taste so much so we had to leave some of it We had the vegetarian pizza served burnt at the base On asking for a replacement the waiter says it might take a while to prepare a new one Only the lasagne was slightly upto the mark The service was literally horrible being a Sunday everyone was just chilling on their own I guess I would recommend you to try out other places and save a large pocket pinch by avoiding this place ,3.0,1

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,This was one of those places on my list that I have been wanting to try for the longest time that I can remember I specifically wanted to try out the Sushi Veg in this place I remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for Japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available In any case I ordered a stater shanghai rolls which was average and finally went ahead and ordered Sushi for myself wife and a pizza for my daughter The sushi was good but not as good as the one I had tried at Mamagoto my fav place for asian cuisine The pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic Italian restaurants in the city I also tried their creme brulee best of the lot which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping In my opinion they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself I would have rated it 3 5 but for their really slow service and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings All in all an average place to try out I might go back to try some of their other items on the menu Ambiance 3 5 Food 3 5 5 Service 2 5 5,3.0,1
Eat India Company,It was supposed to be a really casual lunch and we didn t expect this place to be nice but were surprised for sure So it s a nice restaurant with well arranged furniture and light Has a buffet lunch which is very convenient for Software professionals and casual lunches with friends I have small complaints which are listed in the end but apart from that I had a nice time So in the spread something that I loved dearly was the Chilly Prawns I just couldn t get enough of it It was amazing The chicken was alright But I can say but prawns were the best Although they were really small but can t complain much They didn t give us fish even after we asked for it Staff attentive and service was okay Ambience very nice place looks good clean effort was put in to make it look nice Food food was definitely good I liked it quite a lot apart from the desserts They were pretty bad Complaints Starting with the ice cream guy they have a cold stone ice cream He broke a water glass on the bar counter while making ice cream technically just mixing it and he used his already worn gloves and ice cream scoop to push the glass pieces away Didn t wash his hands or change his gloves or wash his scoop For all we know the glass pieces were still on his hands and scoop Second is also with the ice cream guy we found hair inside the ice cream he made us and returned it immediately Lost our appetite soon after that Third is with one of the waiters probably didn t want to give us fish even after we asked him to get us some which was on the buffet menu He agreed to get some but never showed up with it I hope it s his memory and nothing else that caused the problem Hopefully management reads this and takes action on it If those factors are avoided then will go again definitely ,3.0,1

Club Rogue,The ambience was decent but we went for a ladies night and it was a tad bit crowded understandable The music was good the only downside to the whole thing was that the person giving out drinks at the counter was downright ignoring us We actually became a little uncomfortable after that because we were right in front of him waving hands not drunk at all because we were asking for out first drink of the night and he was handing out drinks to everyone else except us Looks like he had something againts us ,3.0,1

GD's,Have been hearing a lot about this amazing burger place opposite to DLF what an amazing join with live grill and freshly made burgers loved the friendly staff and a uniquely named menu ordered Galaxy and milky way burger which were amazing and cooked to perfection the charcoal grill gives the burger a unique BBQ taste with chunky chicken pieces in it On rush hours the service time can go lengthy limit parking space the shop shares a juice center which is a plus point to grab some quick fresh juice or soft drink to go with your burger and is open all night Feels moderately over priced however considering it being surrounded by MNC s and the taste maybe it s justified and definitely it s a worth visiting place ,3.0,1

Ulavacharu,Have been to this place after hearing lot of good reviews I can rate the food as very delicious specially pachimirchi Kodi Pulao accurately spicy varied dishes in the menu but I had a very bad day with respect to service First of all there were hardly 2 waiters who were available and even though it was not crowded they were unable to address the customers and were confused with the menu as once they said bamboo chicken was not available and then when ordered some other starter came back with bamboo chicken secondly after some time those 2 waiters were missing and the whole floor was left without anyone to take care of guests I hope that this is one of those cases and there wouldn t be other customers facing the same issue given the brand they own ,3.0,1

SKYHY,Place is nice it has open area on terrace and closed area too Have been here twice and found that the service is nice but the quality of food is not that great DJ was good And once out of 2 times have experienced power cut and the team was not able to have the backup for 30mins But this might be a one off case so should be fine Its an average place to be there ,3.0,1

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Cascade is a luxury dining restaurant that falls under the notorious Carlson Group of Hotels and offers multi cuisine dishes The tremendous ambiance fully complements the canons of the place and instantly lightens up your mood into musical An addition to the offering is an elaborate buffet for foodies Cascade is in Gachibowli main road It s located on the second floor of the property While the lobby is inviting it only dispels all the doubts about the food being as inviting as the lobby As you enter Cascade you are greeted by a Buddha Statue As soon as you enter their food counter spread all over at the corner side we had a few veg and non veg salad sausage with spinach Started picking one of one and observed fish was stale and seems It was reused The chicken was hard and sausage was almost beginning to wring itself Actually none of the salads were any good partly because they weren t fresh something that is supposed to be figurative of a salad freshness Starters We had veg and non veg soups lots of breads naan roti kulchas Veg starters included paneer tikka potatoes veg mix fried Non veg included couple of chicken items and fish They had little variety of but not so tasty starters Anyway rushed towards main course Dal makhani which was waste Or in another word I was searching for Dal Makhani flavor And I feel in this level of restaurant at least Dal Makhani should be right Moved ahead and tried vegetable dum biryani with Mutton curry I must appreciate mutton curry was yummy and cooked properly but in the same dum biryani could be better For desserts it s a good mix of Indian including Hyderabadi bestseller Double Ka Meetha and European delicacies I am not much of a dessert being but was glad to see a large number of desserts in the buffet Overall I will not call it astonishing stuff but it has wonderful musical spacious place with decent ambiance but they need to improve food side a lot ,3.0,1

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,I have visited Jonathan s kitchen on many occasions One thing that strikes me is for such a big restaurant their service is not so nice Also they denied us Zomato gold services saying we were sitting in Komatose however as per their front staff they told us to sit in Komatose as they didn t have seat in Jonathan s kitchen but the food menu and staff will all be from Jonathan s Hence we sat and ordered and later found out no gold accepted I have tried their buffet ala cart Sushi and everything else Nothing extraordinary The only benefit is it is close to my place ,3.0,1

Prism Club & Kitchen,I have been on Friday night and reached at round 10pm It was almost full we hardly get space for standing They occupied huge space and designed interior amazingly which definitely deserve a cover charge as its into business but one thing which nowhere make sense to taking 500 bucks for just entry out of 2k when every items price also decent to take your business ahead We could not order any snacks except one as we had to carry on hand and could spoil our party mood I must say either they should revoke their concept of charging for entry or should be take responsibility to offer seats atleast when you are visiting as couple or in group Dj was playing good track and it was enjoyable moment we spent Zomato is showing 1200 for two ppl which is really surprising even though you cant step down to this place until unless spend 2k bucks so be aware and keep your pocket tight as this place is not for normal class people ,3.0,1

Eat India Company,This place has a good ambiance and is a treat for people wanting to take pictures but that s about it Went on a Sunday and there was no crowd at all The AC was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside The service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming Starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good the pace of refills needed to improve I honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course The stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that s about it It s expensive factoring in the food and service you get These guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment Could give it a try for the ambiance though ,3.0,1

Pista House,Pista house s haleem is what I look forward to always On a vacation to Nizam s Hyderabad we thought we will try one of their chicken dishes and thus chose Dum ka Murg Tandoori roti A little above average food and overly filled staff who made it a little rushed up dining experience Didnt get time to breathe coz the staff kept coming to check on you No doubt thei service was prompt but at times felt it was too prompt They should give customers little time to breathe to order food and finish it with peace Next will try their haleem and some desserts too ,3.0,1

Shanghai Chef 2,Thier platters might sound a bit confusing since they are more like normal starters but definitely taste good A must try item on their menu is bamboo rice It has tiny bamboo shoots with lemon grass and fresh flavours I absolutely loved it Do not try the 8 treasure hot pot which is listed as a must try on their menu I did not find anything very special in it Its curry was just the same as that of paneer chilli and I was expecting a little moderations there ,3.0,1

Behrouz Biryani,Ordered the much hyped about Behrouz biriyani today Wanted to have it since ages So today when the package came I was really thrilled The biriyani comes in a stunning package And as you open it the room fills with amazing Biriyani smells The biriyani was looks good with a lot of almonds and greens as garnishing on top The biriyani comes with raita and a gulab jamun too The biriyani is quite different from the other popular biriyani in Hyderabad This one is extremely sutle in taste The chicken was tender and was breaking apart easily The rice grains were staying apart and was expertly cooked Overall the biriyani was a really good experience But I personally prefer the spicy type when it comes to Biriyani but this biriyani is different and it is mouth wateringly delicious in a completely different way ,3.0,1

Eat India Company,A group of 4 we decided to visit this place on Saturday evening The location is quite on the main road however the parking and the entry is terrible They can surely improve in this aspect as it can be a big turn off After entering the restaurant we were quite impressed with the ambience and the decor It had a very India taste to it They had old locks keys doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look Coming to the food there is a plethora of options on their menu Instead of going through it all we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer Hariyali Paneer Tikka and Corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination Corn cubes cannot be missed here My friend ordered a Chicken starter which was quite average though Moving to main course we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries Paneer Lababdar Mushroom curry and Nizami Handi seemed like good choices Food was decent The service was not impeccable It ca surely be improved Also they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal Quite a surprise The price point is a little on the higher side probably much more than average It can be a great negative They accepted gold on food so yay Overall a good experience but probably not one worth visiting again ,3.0,1

Frio Bistro,I was at this bistro for dinner with my friends recently on a weekday Ambience was decent It was a tad too dark for my liking but the spacious table setting and the gentle hit tracks playing in the background made up for a nice dinner setting Service was pretty decent The waiter who attended our table was courteous and prompt in serving The food was a big disappointment though Of all the dishes we ordered few starters and the tiramisu cake were the only saving grace Main course Spinach ravioli Belly dance pizza Stuffed chicken breast and Greek chicken sovlakhi was a total disaster Not a single person from our group of 6 could find anything tasty from this bunch We finished the meal off with tiramisu and dbc cake which was good and filling Overall an average restaurant If you re looking for good Italian this is not the place to be CIBO house is ,3.0,1

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,This restaurant space in Gachibowi is the fusion of Urban Asia and Eat India Company which are under the same roof with different names Ambience This is very much spacious having multiple separated halls for group dining with cozy ambience This restaurant is themed with village style vintage wooden decors all around the place Most of the interior walls are covered with vintage wooden doors windows and locks And also there is a separate dining hall where one of the wall is completely covered with photo frames of old nizami Kings and their belongings Food We went here for a dinner buffet The food is really delicious and this was the first time I was liking Sea food in the starters All the starters are really good but Kung Pao fish and Prawns parsely dry are the best of its kind Dinner Buffer Menu Starters 1 Murgh Haryali Tikka 2 Lahsooni Murgh Tikka 3 Kung Pao Fish 4 Prawns Parsely dry 5 Crispy Potato Corn cube 6 Sichuan Baby Corn 7 Paneer Angar Tikka 8 Corn Tikka 9 French fries Main Course 1 Bindi Jai Puri 2 Yellow Dal Tadka 3 Palak Paneer 4 Murgh Lababdar 5 Mutton do Pyaza 6 Murgh Dum biryani 7 Sabzi Dum biryani 8 Garlic noodles 9 Butter Naan and Roti 10 Curd Rice 11 Khow suey Salads 1 Tossed Salad 2 Crispy Noodles Salad 3 Kimchi Salad 4 Grilled chicken salad Desserts 1 Pineapple Tarts 2 Chocolate Brownie 3 Pastries 4 Shahi Tukda 5 Varied flavors of ice creams We don t have much variety in desserts but the ice creams here are really good and served with different luscious toppings Just looking at them will trigger the cravings in your mouth Service The only saddest part of this restaurant is the service that they provide Though it is a buffet All the starters will served to the table There is a lot much interval from one starter to the other starter that they serve And you will feel that half the time your plate is empty and you need to keep on waiting for them to serve The service part of this restaurant is really irritating and this needs to be corrected with much importance Value for money The dinner buffet here costs around Rs 650 per person And you will definitely feel that this place is worth your money Be prepared to bear with the bad service and rest you will definitely enjoy Have a great dining and good day ,3.0,1
PourHouse7,Pocket friendly place for a quick round of drinks Tried their LIIT Tequila Sunrise along with a bunch of Chicken Fish veg starters In the drinks the Tequila Sunrise stood out with a distinct flavor while LIIT was just the standard one Would recommend to try the Chicken Nazakath it lived up to its name with juicy and succulent pieces The place has 2 2 on Zomato Gold and offers happy hours every day till evening So saves the pocket pinch ,3.0,1

Tiki Shack,The quality of food and drink was really good What turned out to be the biggest let down was the service A few of the waiters are really ignorant They look for bigger groups to serve and circle around them only With much effort we got a waiter to come and take our order After waiting for half an hour we enquired only to find out that the waiter had not put in the order at all We got a new waiter to whom we had to re iterate the whole thing Although the new waiter was really polite and helpful but our experience was already ruined So my humble request is if you don t like to serve a smaller group mention it outside and we will definitely avoid your restaurant ,3.0,1

Diners Pavilion,My second visit to this place Visited this restaurant once back in 2016 and was thoroughly disappointed This visit was better than the last one Was here for a team lunch with my colleagues we opted for the buffet The ambience of this place is decent There were some minor issues such as the table we sat on was uneven there was no salt and pepper on the table also there were no condiments Upon requesting the waiter served us Ketchup and Green chutney As we sat the waiters started serving the starters They included hara bhara kabab aloo tikki garlic paneer tandoori pineapple crispy corn and Chilly eggs Tandoori pineapple was a little different and in a good way relief from the barbecued pineapple dish that we often have at other restaurants Crispy corn hara bhara kabab and the tikki were also good The egg dish was average and garlic paneer was below average Veg Tom Yum soup was decent The main course was a bit disappointing Paneer Butter Masala tasted very bad and the rice dish with the tag name Kashmiri Pulao wasn t actually Kashmiri Pulao The two other Veg curries tasted average The desserts consisted only Vanilla ice cream Gulab Jamun and Moong dal halwa This was probably the most distasteful Moong dal halwa I ve ever eaten The service was prompt But this place didn t give me any reason to why I should visit again at least for a buffet The only way they re different is that they offer complimentary unlimited soft drinks But I think that is not good enough to keep customers coming back I ve visited places less than 1Km from this place who charge the same amount and yet have more variety of food If they can t increase the varieties they should start serving different new food compared to others because I m not visiting again if I can have similar food and better somewhere else Ambience 3 Service 3 5 Taste 3 Value for money 3 Overall 3 P S Apologies for the bad pictures,3.0,1

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area we have other choices Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there 1 Crabmeat Soup This soup was thick with minced crab meat The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce vineager and crushed pepper The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds 2 Corn Cubes A must try out platter The dish was innovative The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency 3 Chicken Yakitori I did not like this preparation It was very dull and tasteless There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor Main Course 1 Manchow Chicken Fried Rice The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own Dessert 1 Bangkok Custurd I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts It tasted like Firni As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls It was just yum for the greedy tongue Total Rs 1396 Inclusive of taxes Cobclusion The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card No coordination among the staffs Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions Its just okayish for casual dinner lunch I will think twice to visit this place again ,3.0,1

Behrouz Biryani,The only biryani which tasted a little sweet to me Sometimes when u order curd rice and expect nothing fancy but you see some garnishing with pomegranate and then you have mixed feelings Coz the dish looks pretty but Similarly the packaging is great and garnished with nuts and looks very rich But at the end wasn t satisfying ,3.0,1

Frio Bistro,Frio is set in a dark toned theme with black walls and complementing prismic mirrors with dim lighting to set mood for a quiet interesting evening conversation The music is contemporary and thankfully not too loud It moulds into the environment without intruding into your private space Service was fine We had to keep a lookout for waiters rather than them looking out for us but were courteous and friendly Here is what we ordered 100 arabica cold coffee basic and just right Creamy and not too sugary Dark chocolate shake absolute yum and sinful It tastes exactly as you would want it to The only ask since it s categorized as thickshake it should be thicker but I guess that s the case with shakes served anywhere in the city Chicken ala plancha Sheer dissapointment especially given that it was in chef s special menu It was as ordinary as ordinary can be We ordered scallion rice on the side as the dish is incomplete without carbs It s basically a tomato gravy with chicken and hardly any seasoning Wouldn t recommend Lamb ravioli It s a shame we don t get ravioli in most of the outlets across the city serving pasta Even if they do it s mostly vegetarian spinach and ricotta cheese without exception To our delight Frio doesn t disappoint here The ravioli is good doesn t make it to my top 5 list but still good Ravioli was cooked well herbed garlic bread on side was great and so was the tomato gravy We couldn t get to dessert as we ordered our food during the final order 20 mins before closing but I have heard that their tiramisu is great All in all Frio is a good place to visit In terms of food you could love or let s say not love the place basis what dish you ordered I won t be a frequent here but wouldn t mind going back for another try either Happy dining ,3.0,1

Hyper Local,I and my friend went here to watch the IPL live screening and have some good time One good thing was that they have 2 2 on drinks through Zomato gold The food pretty decent too but what I didn t like was that it didn t have good options in drinks especially non alcoholic We eventually went for Masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad We asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldn t take it back Wasn t happy with the service Also the live music there wasn t great ,3.0,1

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,I just wonder how people praise the food and service Maybe the day was different for me but I was really very dissapointed with the service they had given We asked for raita and we were served after we almost finished our mandi I hate such late servings Mandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great Instead I find it better at other places Ambience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants However the choice of music could have been better Overall I would say its just a waste to ur pocket and palate ,3.0,1

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Wanted to checkout this new place and this visit we visited Mazzo and opted for A la Carte Overall only the Drinks Soup and Fish and Chips were good service was good The value of food experience was not satisfactory and I wouldn t visit next time Asian Clear Soup Chicken Just Warm Sweet Corn Soup Chicken This is better than Clear Soup Lamb Pepper Fry Cold Rubbery No Sign of Pepper Tasted like South Indian Dry Chicken Curry Roasted Spring Chicken Tasted Bland due to thickness of Chicken Breast Fish and Chips This was decent enough Chicken Fish Lamb Dinner Wine Scotch,3.0,1

Zega - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Was waiting for longtime to be Zega with the rating it possesed B B Zega Mojito Herbal Delight Oriental Fantasy Blushing Dragon were ok but not that great Chilli chicken fish paneer were also of subtle taste The lamb starter should have been more soft in eatable consistency Egg and chicken friedrice was not having any salt Veg Thai Curry was ok to some extent Diff types of chicken noodles were ordered which was of average taste Schezwan veg fried rice was below average Somehow not satisfied with the quality of food served or the flavours or the service Disappointing for the price paid and the food we had ,3.0,1
Beyond Flavours,We happened to go to this place on last sunday and it was mothers day and they had flat 50 on the buffet meal for the mother which i really liked Needless to say the Ambience and music was really good We had a reservation but had to wait fir 10 mins to get a seat They served us mango juice as wrlcome drink which tasted really good The buffet spread was one of a kind Strters Veg paneer tikka veg spring roll and veg cutlet They were lil cold but the taste wad good Non veg chicken kebab chicken manchurian and fish Fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot Chicken was fair enuf Singapore Noodles Egg salad and pasta They were good but it was cold Main course mutton rogan josh chicken tikka masala palak paneer All were equally good Biriyani Egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great Desserts moong dal halwa tasted really yumm ice cream gulab jamun cut fruits banana cake The staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slow We had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full They could improve the above points to stand better Overall 3 2,3.0,1
Frio Bistro,I wish I could give it a 3 5 but don t have the option Just for the record it deserves a strong 3 closer to a 4 We tried the Pizza Chicken Breast stuffed with spinach spaghetti followed by deserts The Turkish Pizza was the stand out dish for us we did not expect that The others were also very good and I would go again for sure The Tiramisu although looked and smelled great was the biggest let down The Bakhlava was just okay not a bad attempt The Cheese cake on the other hand was yumm Overall I would recommend this place with a word of caution that it is on the expensive side We ended up paying about a 1200 per head ,3.0,1

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,We opted for alakarte here But the took a round of the food variety for buffet it was pretty good But the dessert section didn t interest me much The buffet had dumplings sushi which I felt were food for buffet We we in mood to eat proper Chinese We ordered a pork dimsum stir fried chicken starter Another chicken main course and fried rice Everything was good But then comes the bill part I Really don t know how they missed the Zomato 1 1 to cut from the bill Also they had so 91 bucks extra S Tax apart from GST Which made us change the bill again Honestly speaking after serving good food missing the gold and adding extra money apart from GST decreases the moral value for the place Kindly try avoiding the addition of that Rest food is good Service if good Can come back again for another turn of Chinese ,3.0,1
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,I was feeling like having a late night shake in the pleasant weather and therefore I ordered one through this place Fruit pebble shake was the one which I ordered using Zomato but I think they delivered me the wrong one The shake has the taste of chocolate cookies so it was definitely not fruit Irrespective of that the taste of the shake was average and I think they can improve their bar ,3.0,1

Olive Garden,Have been here many times I was a frequent at their madhapur branch since 2006 Its a quiet place and family friendly The lift is old dark and horrible It feels it will breakdown except that it doesn t They tried installing another lift but that turned out to be scarier that the first one Coming to the food Its just okay Nothing outstanding or too bad Starters and Chicken items are usually good enough Their tandoori chicken doesn t have breast portion I couldn t understand the rationale behind it its just leg thigh and wings And yes I don t know why they have downgraded their crockery They serve curries in smaller household type steel bowls ,3.0,1

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Having heard a lot about this place and my curiosity to try a new cuisine that s a part of India but different from the other usual cuisines led me and a bunch of my friends to Zing s for dinner First up we were greeted with a distinct smell of raw pork which was mildly unpleasant The starters were quite good spicy chicken momos and the pork preparations pork belly and some kind of chilly fried pork The main course however was disappointing or perhaps we expected something else The Ramyum noodles tasted like a bland version of Top Ramen and the noodles had a strange texture to them There was not enough broth either which you tend to expect from any kind of ramen noodles The Teriyaki chicken rice was a tad too sweet for my palette personally The best thing would be the prices everything is so resonably priced it s not easy to find non veg especially pork beef etc at these prices One major area of feedback would be the service They have an extremely laidback dont really care attitude and it took a bit of effort for us to get their attention and get them to the table each time A little more effort from the management and they could be do loads better than they are currently maybe even start a franchise Value for money 3 5 5 Service 2 5 Ambience 3 5 Overall 3 5,3.0,1

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,This restaurant has its priorities straight Unlike AB s Flechazo and Barbeque Nation that swing for the fences and end up failing many times this place has hit a sweet balance between Hospitality and Taste Which means you have none of the irritating fake friendly over eager monkeys from the above mentioned places pushing and prodding you to try weird stuff even if you don t want to Instead you get a homely little corner where you can sit quietly and be left alone to mind your business until you order for something Very professional indeed The starters are awesome here they actually set the tone for the things to come This place features a wide range of delectable options for vegetarian diners as well which is a big step up from its competitors Kebabs are to die for Having said that the main meal was nothing to write home about They have tried a lot of things from Mughlai Intercontinental to Chinese but somehow these dishes don t come together on the plate But what actually took my heart away what this joint EXCELS in hands down compared to ANY FREAKING RESTAURANT IN THE CITY is the Desserts department For someone who loves sweets it s a psychedelic experience The variety and taste will haunt you for days The desserts are neither too sweet nor too rich Just the type that the northern crowd will go berserk about I was thoroughly satisfied and if you leave out the clove heavy gravy of mutton and the generic dishes of the main menu then the place is a RockaRolla discovery Definitely worth one visit and then the count will just keep on ticking ,3.0,1
Club Rogue,Read mixed reviews about this place But the only thing which dragged us here is that the DJ here plays Bollywood songs and we were satisfied with the DJ and the dance floor The place is also very beautiful But the service here sucks the waiters are rude We couldn t order food as the waiters weren t responding properly Even for drinks tired of waiting for them to take order we went to the bar and ordered So if you you to enjoy only the dance floor only them I would recommend this place ,3.0,1
Club Rogue,My friend gave his birthday treat here We opted for the buffet going on there Buffet was not that great Buffet had one chicken starter one vegetarian starter one main course we opted for non vegetarian option choice of roti biryani and Gilab jamun The ambiance was great We clicked alot of pictures there It was fun overall ,3.0,1

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,I went here for a team dinner We opted got Buffet There is definitely a great variety on the menu but I did not like the food much It was just okay As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton that was not the case here Ambience is definitely 10 10 Maybe go for a la carte instead of Buffet Unfortunately I do not have any pictures ,3.0,1
Hunger Maggi Point,It s a very small food joint like a pan shop and very crowded since there are many other food joints in the same lane It s nothing exceptional but if you really love Maggi then you can give it a try We tried fried chicken maggi but are doubtful of it being halal If anyone knows about it please let me know ,3.0,1

10 Downing Street,A grand entry decent ambience and average food That just about sums it up for 10 Downing Street Just as the name suggests the place has a very British feel to it as far as the ambience goes It s cost warm and has great layout But the layout proves to be a negative as well We went here for lunch and the place was very loud The good point was that we got a great seat with excellent view The service was decent but one of the dishes we ordered did not arrive I hope they write down what was ordered The food itself was good We had chicken wings chicken Tikka seekh kabab tandoori veg platter and drinks The food was good and arrived a tad slow Overall it is a good place to have a drink and be merry ,3.0,1

Prism Club & Kitchen,Big on ambience food and music Miserably fails at politeness Called up this place to reserve a table for two on a Friday night They said please walk in No reservations required for two The place was sparsely filled but most tables had a reservation and the ones remaining were well About to be reserved so you can t sit If you re less than three head to the bar because that s exactly where they like pushing everyone to The service otherwise is decent but not sure why they are so finicky about holding on to a table that is not occupied The place is all lights and show and great for nightlife The food is decent and the options are a plenty on both the food and liquor front ,3.0,1

Driven Cafe,I love this place Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me Spacious evergreen english songs eg Nirvana Bryan Adams on the back ground It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit talk sip coffee enjoy the background songs not a noisy cafe like some other cafes This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city But the negative point is that they don t have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items ,3.0,1

Hyderabadi Daawat,Looking at the overall rating the close promixity to our office visited this place for lunch along with my team today Looks like this place is mainly for IT people as most of it is occupied by 3 batches 12 Nothing great to say about the interiors ambiance it is decent enough I am the odd man out in the group being the only vegetarian but will put in words what my colleagues said about the non veg food Veg Not that great we ordered Panneer tikka palak sheek kebab for starters Sabzi Nawabi Handi butter naan for mains Panneer is rubbery not soft indicating it is not fresh Palak sheek kebab is kind of bland with no taste not cooked properly As suggested by the staff we opted for Sabzi Nawabi Handi which is a bad decision as the taste is not that good Service wise they took lot of time in getting our order which is a let down as well Non veg Sikendari Raan is a standout dish whereas the other Murg Musallam is bland with no taste spiceness to it Same is the case with Yakhni Shorba which tasted like hot gravy water Overall I would not suggest anyone to visit this place considering the inconsistency in the food they served along with bad service ,3.0,1

Olive Garden,We ve been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since I am a big fan of starters So as soon as we reached the spot we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the Gachibowli area The interior was also tiny and seemed confined Anyhow we ordered chicken garlic chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant The staff were ok not quick but not rash though Even though they got our food very late they somehow tried to convince us with something non relatable situations Forgetting all that we just wanted to concentrate on our food As soon as we had our first bite the first thing that came to our mind was it s good but not great The flavour in the Biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices Overall it s a place where you can visit once in a while if you stay work near Gachibowli This is not a place to visit from a long distance Food 3 5 Service 3 5 Ambience 3 5 Value for money 2 5 5 Overall 3 5,3.0,1

The Old Madras Baking Company,The Old Madras has been our go to place for some nice coffee with a sandwich whenever the weather is nice and you want to enjoy it sitting outdoor The coffee is quite good with a lot of variations available The best part is the freshly baked breads Those beautiful soft breads make the sandwiches all the more tasty when grilled with butter Even the puffs and Victoria cake are nice to have Coming to the worst part the service In all my visits over the past couple of months this has been the biggest turn off about this place Almost always I had to go to the counter to place the order instead of a waiter coming over Second would be the cleanliness of the outdoor seating More often than not you can see flies buzzing over the tables Though the kitchen looks quite hygienic ,3.0,1
